# Testing rivet

What a merge gate has to run so that a red test cannot hide, and why each
line is there.

## Why this page exists

Until 2026-09-14 the merge gate ran only the `--lib` test binaries. Three
integration tests had been red on develop for weeks without anyone seeing
them, and `cargo test -p rivet-codec` could not run at all without
`--features nvidia`: `tests/nvdec_smoke.rs` failed to compile, and a test
target that does not compile stops cargo before *any* target in the crate
runs. A regression in any rivet-codec integration test was invisible.

The fixes, and what each red turned out to be, are in the commits that
introduced this page. This page is the rule that keeps it from recurring.

## Environment

```sh
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=D:/rust-target/<worktree>   # any dir; C: is small on the dev box
git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update --init   # crates/{h26x,av1,aac,ac3,dts,opus,mp3,vorbis,lossless,prores,vp8,vp9,mpeg2,mpeg4,png,jpeg,webp,imagecodecs} must not be empty
```

No CMake and no codec library is needed: every audio codec is a workspace
crate (`crates/opus`, `crates/mp3`, `crates/vorbis` replaced libopus through
`audiopus_sys`, minimp3, lewton and the run-time-loaded LAME on 2026-10-03),
and so is every video and still-image codec (`crates/av1` replaced rav1e and
rav1d, and `crates/png`, `crates/jpeg`, `crates/webp` and `crates/imagecodecs`
the `image` crate, jpeg-encoder and libwebp, the same day), and openh264 went
too, so no build needs NASM.

The workspace's `Cargo.toml` builds `rivet-av1`, `rivet-vp9`, `rivet-png`,
`rivet-jpeg`, `rivet-gif`, `rivet-tiff`, `rivet-webp` and `rivet-vp8` at
`opt-level = 2` in dev and test
builds (`[profile.dev.package.*]`), so a debug test run encodes and decodes
real pictures in seconds rather than minutes; the rest of the workspace stays
unoptimised. A `[patch]` entry makes rivet-tiff's git dependency on rivet-png
the `crates/png` submodule, so one copy of the PNG crate is built; another
makes rivet-webp's git dependency on rivet-vp8 the `crates/vp8` submodule.

## The gate

Every test target of every crate — unit tests, integration tests and doc
tests — under each feature set below. No `--lib`, no `--test` lists: every
target compiles without its hardware feature now, so a plain `cargo test -p`
runs all of them, and a new test file is in the gate the moment it exists.

```sh
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-frame
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-container
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-aac --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-ac3 --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-dts --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-opus -p rivet-mp3 -p rivet-vorbis --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-lossless --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-prores -p rivet-vp8 -p rivet-vp9 -p rivet-mpeg2 -p rivet-mpeg4 --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-av1 --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-png -p rivet-jpeg -p rivet-webp --release
cargo test --no-fail-fast --manifest-path crates/imagecodecs/Cargo.toml --workspace --release

cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec --features serde
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec --features h26x-fallback
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec --features av1-sw-fallback,h26x-fallback
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec --features nvidia
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-codec --features amd

cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder --features h26x-fallback
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder --features av1-sw-fallback,h26x-fallback
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder --features nvidia
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder --features nvidia,av1-sw-fallback,h26x-fallback
cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-transcoder --features server,ipc,batch,thumbnail,image

cargo test --no-fail-fast -p rivet-yolo-example --features cuda,directml,openvino,image-jobs
```

Judge each command by three things, never by the absence of a `FAILED` line:

1. the exit code is 0,
2. it printed one `test result: ok.` line per target. A target that did not
   compile prints no `test result:` line at all — it looks like silence, not
   like a failure, and
3. its output has no `warning: ` line from the compiler (the `generated N
   warnings` summary lines count as the same warning). Test targets are
   compiled with `cfg(test)`, so an import or item used only outside tests
   warns here and nowhere else: `cargo build` of the same crate stays clean.
   The nvidia lib-test build carried one such warning (an unused
   `ColorMetadata` import in `encode/nvenc/mod.rs`) past a gate that only
   counted `cargo build` warnings.

`--no-fail-fast` matters: without it the first red target stops the run and
every target after it goes unreported.

## What each feature set adds

| Feature set | Why it is in the gate |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Everything that needs no feature. |
| `h26x-fallback` | The software H.264 / H.265 encode tier becomes a dispatch fallback. |
| `av1-sw-fallback,h26x-fallback` | **The only set in which the software round-trip tests actually round-trip**: the AV1 tests encode with rivet's own software AV1 encoder (and skip without it; the AV1 decoder is in every build). `new_codecs_e2e`'s `av1_in_software_8_and_10_bit` runs here. |
| `nvidia` | Compiles and runs `nvdec_smoke`, `nvenc_caps`, `nvenc_reset`, and the NVENC / NVDEC arms of dispatch. |
| `nvidia` + software | NVDEC decoding what the software AV1 encoder encoded: the dispatch order a GPU host with the fallbacks on really runs. The only set that caught NVDEC decoding no AV1 at all (the parser was told the stream was AV1 Annex B); no other set reaches that path, because without `nvidia` rivet's own AV1 decoder decodes and without `av1-sw-fallback` the AV1 tests skip. |
| `amd` | Compiles `amf_decode_pixels` and the AMF arms. |
| `serde` (rivet-codec) | The structured (serde) forms of the filter types. |
| `server,ipc,batch,thumbnail,image` | Compiles and runs `server_api` (`#![cfg(feature = "server")]`) and the unit tests behind the front-end features: the HTTP API, IPC, the batch manifest, thumbnails and still images (`mode=image`, metadata-keep into stills). `ipc` serves only on Unix but compiles and tests everywhere. The image tests (`crates/rivet/src/image/tests.rs`) round-trip every written format — on a 160x120 synthetic picture at quality 90, AVIF 44.70 dB RGB PSNR in 1,032 bytes, WebP 37.29 dB in 520 bytes, JPEG 37.98 dB in 1,907 bytes, PNG and lossless WebP exact — decode every raster input the workspace's own encoders make (PNG, TIFF, BMP and lossless WebP exactly), and write a 4200x72 AVIF as a `grid` and read it back whole. AVIF decodes in every build, so this set needs no AV1 feature. |
| `rivet-aac`, `--release` | The AAC encoder and decoder (the `crates/aac` submodule), including both against faad2's decoder (a black box). The ISO/IEC 14496-26 conformance streams run in the crate's own CI (`AAC_CONFORMANCE_DIR`). In release, as CI runs it. |
| `rivet-ac3`, `--release` | The AC-3 / E-AC-3 decoder (the `crates/ac3` submodule): its table and unit tests, and the committed 5.1 vector (made by aften) against liba52's decode of it. The full vector sweep needs `RIVET_AC3_VECTORS` (below). |
| `rivet-dts`, `--release` | The DTS codec (the `crates/dts` submodule): its unit tests, round trips through its own encoder against the known source, and the encoder's streams decoded by libdca's `dcadec` (a black box) against this decoder. |
| `rivet-opus`, `rivet-mp3`, `rivet-vorbis`, `--release` | The Opus, MPEG audio / MP3 and Vorbis encoders and decoders (the `crates/{opus,mp3,vorbis}` submodules): round trips through each crate's own encoder and decoder (strict decoding, SNR, packet-rule and range-coder checks), spec-derived unit tests, malformed-input tests. The downloaded conformance suites — the RFC 8251 Opus test vectors, ISO's MPEG audio conformance sequences, Xiph's Vorbis vectors — run in each crate's own CI and skip here without them. |
| `rivet-lossless`, `--release` | The FLAC and ALAC encoders and decoders (the `crates/lossless` submodule): round trips, the format pieces, and both codecs against the `flac` CLI and Apple's `alacconvert` (built from Apple's open-source ALAC release by `crates/lossless/tools/build-alacconvert.sh`). rivet-codec's `lossless_oracle` runs the same checks through rivet's adapters. |
| `rivet-av1`, `--release` | The AV1 decoder and encoder (the `crates/av1` submodule): unit tests, the twelve AOM test vectors it commits, and round trips through its own encoder. The full AOM and Argon suites are fetched, not committed, and run in the crate's own CI. |
| `rivet-png`, `rivet-jpeg`, `rivet-webp`, `--release`; the `crates/imagecodecs` workspace | The still-image codecs (the `crates/{png,jpeg,webp,imagecodecs}` submodules): PngSuite (committed), the JPEG corpus (committed), round trips through each encoder, and malformed-input tests; Google's WebP test data is fetched by rivet-webp's `tools/fetch_testdata.py`, not committed, and its conformance tests skip without `WEBP_TESTDATA_DIR`. `crates/imagecodecs` (rivet-gif, rivet-bmp, rivet-tiff) is a cargo workspace of its own, excluded from rivet's, so it is tested by its manifest path; its public corpora are fetched by its tools and skip without them. |
| `rivet-prores`, `rivet-vp8`, `rivet-vp9`, `rivet-mpeg2`, `rivet-mpeg4`, `--release` | The video decoders in rivet's decode chain, and their encoders (the `crates/{prores,vp8,vp9,mpeg2,mpeg4}` submodules): spec-derived unit tests, round trips through each crate's encoder, property tests on malformed input, and the conformance material each crate commits — VP8's 18 comprehensive vectors, fourteen small VP9 vectors. Release, because the vector and round-trip tests decode real pictures. The larger suites are fetched, not committed, and skip without them (below). rivet-codec's own tests cover the adapters (`decode/*_sw.rs`) and `prores_dispatch`. |
| *(none)*: `audio_codecs_e2e` (rivet-transcoder) | **Every audio output**: each codec (Opus, MP3, AAC-LC, HE-AAC, HE-AAC v2, Vorbis, AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS) in each file it goes in — a single-file MP4, a QuickTime movie, a WebM, an HLS package (the audio rendition's init and segments joined), an audio-only `.m4a`, `.ogg` / `.opus` and `.mp3` — through `run_job_blocking`, read back with rivet's demuxers and decoded with rivet's decoders: the codec, the channels and rate, the presented length against the source's (exact wherever the file has an end trim), each channel's level and SNR against the source as rivet decodes it; stereo, 5.1 (every speaker in its place) and a passthrough of each of rivet's own outputs. No other implementation is run. |
| *(none)*, both crates: `native_codec_containers` (rivet-codec), `new_codecs_e2e` (rivet-transcoder) | **The output path of VP9, VP8, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2 and ProRes**, with no feature (their encoders are in every build). `native_codec_containers` encodes a synthetic clip with each codec's adapter, muxes it into each file it goes in (WebM, MP4, QuickTime), demuxes it with the streaming demuxer and decodes it with the decoder `create_decoder` picks — codec label, size, frame count, presentation timestamps one frame apart, luma PSNR per frame against the source — and builds the files the demux mappings need (MPEG-4 with its VOL only in the `esds` / Matroska `CodecPrivate` / a `V_MS/VFW/FOURCC` header, `V_MPEG1` / `V_MPEG2`, `V_PRORES` without its frame header, MPEG-1 video in a TS, an MPEG-2 + AC-3 program stream). `new_codecs_e2e` does the same through `run_job_blocking`: a synthetic H.264 clip, the committed H.264 + AAC / MPEG-2 / VP9 fixtures and `test_media/bbb_h264_360p_short.mp4` (skipped when absent) to every codec × file, VP9 as HLS (the joined init + segments decode to every frame; `CODECS="vp09…"`), an `.mpg` source, and the audio each file carries; VP9 10-bit (`vp9_ten_bit_profile_2`: profile 2 in WebM and MP4, decoded back at 10 bits, worst luma PSNR 41.38 dB on the 128x96 synthetic clip), a VP9 bitrate rung (`vp9_bitrate_rung`: 400 kb/s asked, 394 kb/s in the file), and, with `av1-sw-fallback` (it skips without), the software AV1 encoder through rivet's MP4 muxer, demuxer and AV1 decoder (`av1_in_software_8_and_10_bit`: worst luma PSNR 35.15 dB at 8 bits, 36.33 dB at 10). No other implementation is run: the oracle is the source. About a minute in a debug build (VP9 is the slow one). |
| `rivet-yolo-example` with `cuda,directml,openvino,image-jobs` | Compiles every inference backend of the YOLO hooks example and its image-job path. |

### Tests that skip, and why the software set is not optional

The round-trip tests in `crates/rivet/tests` (`fidelity_*`, `e2e`) build
their encoder through `tests/common::try_av1_encoder`. When the build has no
AV1 encoder — no NVENC AV1 silicon, no `av1-sw-fallback` — they print
`SKIP: ...` to stderr and **pass**. Cargo captures stderr of a passing test,
so the `SKIP` is not visible either.

On the dev box (RTX 3090: no AV1 NVENC) a default build's
`fidelity_pattern` finishes in half a second, having encoded nothing; with
the software set it encodes and decodes all 24 frames (about a minute in a
debug build). A green default run is not evidence about those tests. To see
which tests skipped, add `-- --nocapture` and look for `SKIP:`.

Other tests skip, and pass, when a tool they compare against is missing. Each
has a variable that turns the skip into a failure, which CI sets:

| Tests | Needs | Required by |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/aac/tests/faad_oracle.rs` and the encoder's faad tests | faad2's `faad` (`FAAD` names it) | `AAC_REQUIRE_FAAD=1` |
| `crates/opus/tests/vectors.rs` | the RFC 8251 Opus test vectors (opus_testvectors-rfc8251), in `OPUS_TESTVECTORS` or `crates/opus/tests/vectors` | `OPUS_REQUIRE_VECTORS=1` (the crate's CI) |
| `crates/mp3/tests/conformance.rs` | ISO's MPEG audio conformance sequences, fetched by `crates/mp3/tools/fetch_conformance.py`, in `MP3_CONFORMANCE_DIR` | the crate's CI |
| `crates/vorbis/tests/vectors.rs` | Xiph's Vorbis test vectors, fetched into `crates/vorbis/tests/vectors` by `crates/vorbis/tools/fetch-vectors.sh` | `VORBIS_REQUIRE_VECTORS=1` (the crate's CI) |
| `crates/aac/tests/conformance.rs` | the ISO/IEC 14496-26 AAC-LC and HE-AAC streams, fetched by `crates/aac/tools/fetch_conformance.py`, in `AAC_CONFORMANCE_DIR` | `AAC_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1` (the crate's CI) |
| `crates/ac3/tests/ac3_decode_vectors.rs`, the full sweep | the vectors `crates/ac3/tools/make_vectors.sh` makes (aften streams, liba52 references) and Dolby's own streams (`crates/ac3/tools/fetch_dolby_kit.sh`), in the directory `RIVET_AC3_VECTORS` names | `RIVET_AC3_REQUIRE_VECTORS=1` (the crate's CI; the committed 5.1 fixture runs regardless) |
| `crates/dts/tests/dcadec.rs` | libdca's `dcadec` (`DCADEC` names it) | `DTS_REQUIRE_DCADEC=1` |
| `crates/dts/tests/samples.rs` | the public DTS streams `crates/dts/tools/fetch_samples.sh` fetches (VideoLAN's archive), in `DTS_SAMPLES_DIR` | `DTS_REQUIRE_SAMPLES=1` (the crate's CI) |
| `crates/lossless/tests/oracle.rs`, `crates/codec/tests/lossless_oracle.rs` | the `flac` CLI, MKVToolNix (`mkvmerge`, `mkvextract`), Apple's `alacconvert` (`ALACCONVERT` names it) | `RIVET_REQUIRE_LOSSLESS_ORACLES=1` |
| `crates/rivet/tests/fidelity_mediainfo.rs` | MediaArea's `mediainfo` (`MEDIAINFO` names it) | `RIVET_REQUIRE_MEDIAINFO=1` |
| `crates/rivet/tests/fit_e2e.rs`, `hls_rates.rs`, `dts_audio.rs` | an H.264 encoder (a GPU, or `h26x-fallback`); their sources are made by `tests/common/synth.rs` | — |
| `crates/prores/tests/sample.rs` | Apple-encoded ProRes frames: the first 4 MB of Probe.dev's `AppleProRes422.mov` (the curl line is at the top of the test), its path in `PRORES_SAMPLE` | — (skips when unset; the crate's CI sets it) |
| `crates/vp9/tests/vectors.rs` | the 353 public VP9 test vectors, about 34 MB, fetched into `crates/vp9/tests/vectors` by `crates/vp9/tools/fetch-vectors.sh` (`VP9_VECTOR=<substring>` narrows the run) | `VP9_REQUIRE_VECTORS=1` |
| `crates/mpeg2/tests/conformance.rs` | the ISO/IEC 13818-4 video conformance bitstreams, fetched by `crates/mpeg2/tools/fetch-conformance.sh [dir]` (default `target/conformance`), that directory in `MPEG2_CONFORMANCE_DIR` | `MPEG2_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1` |
| `crates/mpeg4/tests/conformance.rs` | ITU-T H.263 and ISO/IEC 14496-4 streams (`crates/mpeg4/tools/fetch-conformance.sh`) and Xvid 1.3.7 as a black box (`crates/mpeg4/tools/xvid-vectors.sh`), in `crates/mpeg4/tests/conformance` or `MPEG4_CONFORMANCE` | `MPEG4_REQUIRE_CONFORMANCE=1` (the crate's CI) |

### Test inputs and oracles: no FFmpeg

No test, fixture or CI step runs FFmpeg (or anything linking libav*), and no
test data is fetched from FFmpeg's hosting. Test inputs are made by this
workspace's own encoders and muxers (`crates/rivet/tests/common/synth.rs`;
`cargo run --example synth_clip` writes one to disk for the CLI jobs), or are
published conformance material fetched from the standards bodies and codec
owners (ITU-T, ISO, Dolby, VideoLAN's sample archive, Xiph). Where an
independent implementation is the oracle it is run as a black box and never
read: the `flac` CLI, Apple's `alacconvert`, faad2, libdca, liba52, aften,
MKVToolNix, MediaInfo, Xvid, and the reference decoders the `h26x` crate's
tools use.

## Known failures

Reds that are already known, so a run that shows them isn't mistaken for a
new regression. Remove an entry when its fix lands.

None at the moment. Add rows as `| Test | Since | What happens |`.

## Traps

- **One `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per worktree.** Two checkouts of this workspace
  that share a target directory reuse each other's builds of the workspace
  crates: the artifact names match, and cargo judges them fresh by the other
  tree's file times. A branch build here silently linked the `rivet-h26x` of a
  checkout at an older develop (1c9ff0a) and failed on its API; a build that had compiled
  would have tested the wrong code. Give each worktree its own directory, or
  `cargo clean -p` the workspace crates when switching.
- **Tests run in parallel inside a binary.** A fixed or pid-named temp path
  is shared by every test in that binary; `dts_audio` failed about one run in
  five because one test removed the directory the other was writing into.
  Use `tempfile::tempdir()` per test.
- **A red that only one feature set shows is still a red.** Rerun it in
  isolation before calling it a flake, and if it is one, find the race.
- **The software AV1 decoder runs on its own thread.** `decode/av1_sw.rs`
  decodes on a worker thread up to three temporal units ahead of the caller,
  so a panic or a hang in the decoder shows up on that thread, not in the
  test's stack. `RIVET_AV1_DECODE_THREAD=0` decodes on the caller's thread
  instead, which is what to set when debugging the decoder. (rav1d, which it
  replaced, needed `debug-assertions = false` in dev builds to stop a false
  positive in its borrow tracker from hanging the tests; that override and
  its stress test are gone with it.)
- **Throughput figures are release-build measurements, not tests.** They are
  `#[ignore]`d tests run by hand:
  `cargo test -p rivet-codec --release --features av1-sw-fallback --test software_av1_roundtrip -- --ignored --nocapture throughput_at_720p`
  (software AV1 encode and decode at 1280x720; on the dev box 2.08 frames/s
  encode, 1.9 megapixels/s, and 25 frames/s, 23 megapixels/s, to decode that
  stream — the crate's quoted ~6 megapixels/s is for streams that use the
  whole toolbox) and
  `cargo test -p rivet-transcoder --release --features image --lib -- --ignored --nocapture png_level_timings`
  (PNG DEFLATE levels on a 2048x2048 picture). Quote the figure with the
  machine and the stream.

## NEON on ARM hardware

CI runs on x86-64 Linux only (safewords-runners), so the NEON (aarch64) paths
are not tested there: rivet-codec's pipeline kernels (the resampler, scaler,
colour conversions, tonemap, denoisers) and the codec crates' kernels. They
are verified by hand on ARM hardware (an aarch64 Linux machine, or Apple
silicon) after a change to them and before a release:

```sh
cargo test -p rivet-h26x --release --locked
H26X_NO_SIMD=1 cargo test -p rivet-h26x --release --locked
cargo test -p rivet-codec --lib --release --locked -- simd colorspace tonemap filter audio::resample
RIVET_PIPE_MAX_SIMD=none RIVET_DENOISE_MAX_SIMD=none RIVET_TONEMAP_SCALAR=1 \
  cargo test -p rivet-codec --lib --release --locked -- simd colorspace tonemap filter audio::resample
```

The kernel tests compare each NEON kernel with its scalar version; the
second and fourth runs repeat everything on the scalar paths. Each codec
crate's README ("NEON on ARM hardware") gives its own pair.

## Not in the gate, and why

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| `qsv` | No Intel GPU on the dev box; builds everywhere. |
| `dpir`, `dpir-cuda`, `dpir-cudnn` | A 130 MB model download; CUDA toolkit at build time for the GPU variants. |
| `rivet-h26x` | The codec submodule has its own gate (conformance suites and encode sweeps, `crates/h26x/tools`), run when the submodule moves. |
