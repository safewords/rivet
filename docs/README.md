# rivet documentation

Reference pages. The top-level [README](../README.md) is the quick tour;
**[architecture.md](architecture.md) is the start-here map** of the codebase.

## Understand the system

| Page | What |
|------|------|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | **Start here** — the system map: the crates, the transcode lifecycle, the execution paths, where hooks fire, and how the front-ends fit. |
| [decisions.md](decisions.md) | **The why** — the load-bearing design decisions (AV1-default output (+ H.264/H.265), no FFmpeg/hand-rolled FFI, GPU scheduling, streaming, HDR→SDR, web-ready defaults) and their rationale. |
| [pipeline.md](pipeline.md) | The end-to-end data flow — demux → decode-once pump → per-rung scale → multi-GPU lease engine → mux, with diagrams + a code map. |

## Code references (what + why, per crate)

| Page | What |
|------|------|
| [codec-decode.md](codec-decode.md) | The `codec` crate, decode side: dispatch tiers, each GPU decoder, rivet's own software decoders (H.264 / HEVC, ProRes, VP8, VP9, MPEG-1 / MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2), GPU detection, bitstream parsers, probe, HDR/SEI. |
| [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md) | The `codec` crate, encode side: encoder dispatch, each HW backend, quality tuning, colorspace, tonemapping, audio. |
| [container.md](container.md) | The `container` crate: demuxers (streaming + per-format), Annex-B conversion, the AV1 MP4 muxer, CMAF/HLS, audio glue. |
| [engine.md](engine.md) | The `rivet` crate internals: the job engine, the reactive multi-GPU scheduler, progress, and the CLI/HTTP/IPC front-ends. |

## Use it

| Page | What |
|------|------|
| [output-spec.md](output-spec.md) | **Configuring a transcode** — the complete `OutputSpec` guide: every builder method, enum, and field, plus how to run a job. |
| [filters/](filters/README.md) | **Video filters** — a page per filter (crop, pad, flip, rotate, grayscale, overlay, brightness/contrast/saturation/invert, the `denoise` family, parameterized `nlmeans`, and the temporal `hqdn3d`), the string + structured-object forms, and per-surface usage. |
| [lossless-audio.md](lossless-audio.md) | **Lossless audio** — FLAC and ALAC: why a web-first engine carries them, the settings, container rules and codec strings, channel order, browser support, and how they were verified. |
| [audio-filters.md](audio-filters.md) | **Audio filters** — `channelmap` (remap / reorder / select channels), the channel + layout vocabulary, and how the input layout is resolved. |
| [batch.md](batch.md) | **Batch manifest DSL** — convert many files from one YAML/JSON file (`rivet batch`): the manifest shape, every key, glob inputs, output rules, and examples. |
| [cli.md](cli.md) | `rivet` CLI reference — every subcommand, flag, and environment variable, with examples. |
| [hooks.md](hooks.md) | **Hooks**: a specific kind for each point of a job (source bytes, probe, decoded frames, encoder frames, stills, artifacts, completed, failed). Verdicts, blocking vs background, fail open or closed, per-job reports, the built-in digest and perceptual-fingerprint hooks, and the HTTP API's `/v1/hooks`. |
| [hooks-cookbook.md](hooks-cookbook.md) | **Hook cookbook**: sixteen worked recipes (size and container gates, source-material hashing, probe limits, blank-frame detection, your own hashing library, filter drift, background forwarding, output caps and manifests, metrics, rejected-job reports, policies, the HTTP API, unit-testing hooks), all compiled in `examples/hook_cookbook.rs`. |
| [inference.md](inference.md) | **Running models on a job's pictures**: the guide to inference on hooks. Which point and which frames, getting pixels into a model (`planar_f32_letterboxed`, normalisation, letterbox coordinates, HDR sources), choosing and running a runtime (ONNX Runtime and its CUDA / DirectML / OpenVINO providers, candle, tract, a model server), warm-up, session pools and CUDA graphs, annotations and gating verdicts, getting results out (report, live forwarding, HTTP API), measured performance, deployment (runtime libraries, containers, Intel compute runtime, Resizable BAR), testing, and a checklist. |
| [hooks-yolo.md](hooks-yolo.md) | **YOLO object detection with hooks**: a YOLO detector (ONNX, through ONNX Runtime) as a decoded-frame and still hook. Getting a model and the runtime, every output layout (v5 to 26), what each picture goes through, reading the boxes from the report, rejecting jobs on what they show, GPUs, throughput, and other runtimes. The code is the `examples/yolo` crate. |
| [ndi.md](ndi.md) | **NDI and live jobs** — `ndi://NAME` as an input or output on every surface (CLI, batch manifest, HTTP API, library), what a live job does with the spec, encode devices and several sources at once, how it keeps in step, live HLS, ending a live job, where the runtime is found, and the tests. |
| [api.md](api.md) | HTTP transcode API (`rivet serve`) — endpoints, request bodies, the job lifecycle, and the OpenAPI / Swagger / Redoc docs. |
| [../bench/](../bench/README.md) | **Quality bench** — the VMAF/SSIM harness: a reproducible corpus, a scorer that upscales each rung to source and scores a mid-clip window, and `run-ladder.sh` to go from a clip and any set of `rivet transcode` flags to a scored ladder. A ladder change is not a result until it has been scored. |

## Change it

| Page | What |
|------|------|
| [testing.md](testing.md) | **The test gate** — every crate × feature set a merge must run (all targets, doc tests included), how to read the result, which tests skip without an encoder, and the feature sets this box cannot build. |
