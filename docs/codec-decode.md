# codec — decode & media inspection

The `codec` crate has two halves: **encode** (AV1 out) and **decode + media
inspection** (everything in). This document is the reference for the *in* half —
how a demuxed bitstream sample becomes a normalized `VideoFrame`, how the crate
detects GPUs and picks a hardware decoder, and the pure-Rust bitstream parsers
that answer "what is this stream?" without a full decode.

For where decode sits in the larger flow (demux → **decode-once pump** → per-rung
scale → multi-GPU encode → mux), read **[docs/pipeline.md](pipeline.md)** first —
this document does not re-explain the end-to-end data flow, it drills into the
decode-side modules the pump calls.

## Why this side of the crate exists the way it does

rivet has no FFmpeg, in any build (see
[No FFmpeg](../README.md#no-ffmpeg)). That means decode cannot lean on an
FFmpeg wrapper crate for the hardware paths — so every GPU vendor's decoder is
**hand-rolled `dlopen` FFI in-tree**: NVIDIA via libcuda + libnvcuvid (CUVID),
Intel via libvpl (oneVPL), AMD via the AMF runtime. No external wrapper crate, no
`bindgen`, no build-time SDK link. The payoff is that `cargo build --features
nvidia|amd|qsv` compiles on **both Windows MSVC and Linux** with nothing but a C
toolchain — the same binary the production fleet ships. The cost is that we own
the vendor ABI: the FFI struct layouts are mirrored by hand from the vendor
headers and pinned with compile-time size assertions (see
[the qsv_ffi ABI layer](#the-qsv_ffi-abi-layer) and the NVDEC ABI witnesses), so
a driver/SDK layout drift fails the build instead of corrupting memory at
runtime.

The output codec defaults to **AV1** (royalty-clean: AV1 + Opus in MP4), with
**H.264 / H.265** also selectable for legacy-player compatibility; the *input*
side accepts an even wider codec set
(H.264, HEVC, VP8/VP9, AV1, MPEG-1/MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, ProRes) because the
job is to transcode whatever a user uploads — on a host whose GPU decodes it,
or on any host at all: rivet's own pure-Rust decoders are the software tier,
always compiled and always in the chain below the hardware —
[`crates/h26x`](../crates/h26x/README.md) for H.264 and HEVC,
[`crates/av1`](../crates/av1/README.md) for AV1, and
[`crates/prores`](../crates/prores/README.md),
[`crates/vp8`](../crates/vp8/README.md), [`crates/vp9`](../crates/vp9/README.md),
[`crates/mpeg2`](../crates/mpeg2/README.md) and
[`crates/mpeg4`](../crates/mpeg4/README.md) for the rest, each written
clean-room from its format's specification and each a git submodule (a
repository of its own). GPU decode is feature-gated per vendor.
(`rav1d-fallback`, which once let the chain fall back to rav1d for AV1, is
kept as a no-op.) No hardware tier takes ProRes, so its software decoder is
the only one. Every backend
implements one trait — [`Decoder`](#the-decoder-trait) — so the pump drives them
all identically (`push_sample` → `decode_next`). The hardware backends emit
`Yuv420p` / `Yuv420p10le`; the software tiers can also emit 12-bit and
4:2:2 / 4:4:4 planar frames, which the colorspace layer narrows before any
encoder sees them, so the rest of the pipeline never branches on which GPU
produced the pixels.

## Module map

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`src/lib.rs`](../crates/codec/src/lib.rs) | Crate root: module declarations + the `ColorSpace` / `PixelFormat` / `VideoFrame` / `GpuDevice` / `GpuVendor` re-exports, and `pixel_format` re-exported from `rivet-frame`. |
| [`src/frame.rs`](../crates/codec/src/frame.rs) | A re-export of the [`rivet-frame`](../crates/frame/README.md) crate ([`crates/frame/src/lib.rs`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs)), which holds the core data types: `VideoFrame`, `PixelFormat`, `ColorSpace`/`TransferFn`, `StreamInfo`, `VideoCodec`, `EncodedPacket`, and the HDR metadata structs (`ColorMetadata`, `MasteringDisplay`, `ContentLightLevel`). They live there so `rivet-container` can use them without this crate's GPU/audio dependencies. |
| [`src/decode/mod.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs) | The `Decoder` trait + `create_decoder` dispatch, the `HardwareThenSoftware` late-fallback guard, `RotatingDecoder`, the `DISABLE_*` / `RIVET_DISABLE_H26X` env knobs, shared NV12/P010 deinterleave helpers, and the capability introspection (`decode_backends`, `decode_capabilities`, `decode_capable_gpu_indices`). |
| [`src/decode/nvdec/`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/mod.rs) | NVIDIA NVDEC/CUVID streaming decode — hand-rolled libnvcuvid FFI with ABI-pinned structs. Split into `ffi.rs` (structs + size witnesses), `state.rs`, `convert.rs` (format validation, display geometry, P016 deinterleave), `callbacks.rs`, `streaming.rs` (the production decoder), `eager.rs` / `push.rs` (retained library/test paths). |
| [`src/decode/qsv_dec.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs) | Intel QSV/oneVPL decode — hand-rolled libvpl FFI, internal-allocation + `FrameInterface::Map`. |
| [`src/decode/amf_dec.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs) | AMD AMF decode over the shared AMF FFI. H.264 and HEVC (8-bit and Main 10) verified on hardware; what the host's GPU decodes is probed from the runtime. |
| [`src/amf_ffi.rs`](../crates/codec/src/amf_ffi.rs), [`src/amf_runtime.rs`](../crates/codec/src/amf_runtime.rs) | The AMF SDK v1.4.36 vtable mirrors (slot offsets pinned by `const` asserts) and the runtime / context lifecycle (dlopen, `AMFInit`, context bound to the chosen AMD GPU, property helpers), shared by the AMF decoder and encoder (`amd` feature). |
| [`src/amf_device.rs`](../crates/codec/src/amf_device.rs) | Windows-only: hand-rolled DXGI/D3D11 dlopen FFI that makes a D3D11 device on a *specific* AMD adapter, so AMF's `InitDX11` binds to the right GPU on a mixed host (gated `windows` + `amd`). |
| [`src/decode/h26x_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/h26x_sw.rs) | **Native H.264 / HEVC decode** on this workspace's own [`h26x`](../crates/h26x/README.md) crate — pure Rust, always compiled, frame + wavefront threaded, SIMD kernels chosen at run time, bit-exact against the JVT / JCT-VC conformance suites. The software tier for the two codecs it serves; refuses (`Unsupported`) up front what it does not do, so the guard rebuilds the next tier. |

## Frame types

**What.** [`rivet-frame`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs) (re-exported unchanged as
`codec::frame`) defines the values every decoder produces and every consumer
reads.

- [`VideoFrame`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L194) — the unit of decoded output:
  `data: Bytes` (the planar pixels), `width`/`height`, a `PixelFormat`, a
  `ColorSpace`, and a `pts`. The pixel buffer is `bytes::Bytes`, which is
  `Arc`-backed — that is load-bearing for the decode-once pump: fanning one
  decoded frame out to N rungs is a `clone()` that bumps a refcount, not a pixel
  copy (see [pipeline.md §2](pipeline.md#2-decode-once--the-shared-pump)).
- [`PixelFormat`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L51) — the planar layouts the crate
  can carry (4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4 at 8/10/12-bit, 10-bit 4:4:4 with alpha,
  NV12/NV21, RGB). The GPU decoders normalize to just `Yuv420p` and
  `Yuv420p10le`; the native H.264/HEVC and AV1 tiers also emit the 12-bit and
  4:2:2 / 4:4:4 formats, and the probe/parsers can *report* formats the encoder
  won't ultimately produce (every encoder takes 4:2:0). [`bytes_per_frame`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L83)
  gives the packed size, and [`from_chroma_and_depth`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L122)
  maps a `(chroma_idc, bit_depth)` pair (what the bitstream parsers extract) to
  the enum, with a defensive `Yuv420p` default.
- [`ColorSpace`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L139) (BT.601/709/2020) and
  [`TransferFn`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L161) (BT.709 gamma, PQ/ST2084, HLG,
  …). These are **deliberately separate**: every decoder already emits
  `VideoFrame { color_space, .. }` and the converters/encoder dispatch on it, so
  keeping the transfer function on a side channel let HDR support land without
  touching every call site. [`TransferFn::from_h273`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L181)
  maps the raw ITU-T H.273 `transfer_characteristics` byte down to the subset the
  pipeline knows.
- [`StreamInfo`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L224) — the demuxer's header
  (codec string, dims, frame rate, duration, source pixel format, color
  metadata). It's the input to `create_decoder` and the output of `probe`.
- [`ColorMetadata`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L248) bundles all HDR-relevant
  signaling: transfer function, raw H.273 `matrix_coefficients` / `colour_primaries`
  / `full_range_flag`, plus optional [`MasteringDisplay`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L317)
  (SMPTE ST 2086 / HEVC SEI 137) and [`ContentLightLevel`](../crates/frame/src/lib.rs#L344)
  (CTA-861.3 / HEVC SEI 144).

**Why.** The metadata sub-struct exists so the source's HDR signaling survives
the trip from the bitstream all the way to the MP4 mux's `colr`/`mdcv`/`clli`
atoms. **Crucially it `Default`s to an SDR BT.709 baseline** (matrix=1,
primaries=1, transfer=Bt709, studio range) — so every existing `StreamInfo { … }`
literal compiles unchanged via `..Default::default()`, and only HDR-aware
producers (the NVDEC sequence callback, the HEVC SEI scanner, the MP4 probe)
populate non-default values. The struct field names are a documented load-bearing
contract: the probe and SEI parsers write them directly and the mux reads them
verbatim, so renaming them silently breaks HDR round-trip.

**Notes / gotchas.**
- The unit conventions on `MasteringDisplay` are exact wire-domain integers
  (chromaticities in 0.00002 steps, luminance in 0.0001 cd/m²) — they are *not*
  scaled, because they pass straight into the MP4 box bytes. The doc comment on
  the struct is the authority.
- `lib.rs` re-exports `ColorSpace`, `PixelFormat`, `VideoFrame`, `GpuDevice`,
  `GpuVendor` at the crate root for convenience; everything else is reached via
  its module.

## The decode dispatch & tiers

**What.** [`decode/mod.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs) defines the
[`Decoder`](#the-decoder-trait) trait and the
[`create_decoder`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L396) /
[`create_decoder_on`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L410) factory that picks a
decoder for a `(codec, StreamInfo)` and an optional GPU index.

### The `Decoder` trait

[`Decoder`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L205) is three methods plus
`stream_info()`:

```rust
fn push_sample(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;  // feed one Annex-B / OBU sample
fn finish(&mut self) -> Result<()>;                     // end-of-stream
fn decode_next(&mut self) -> Result<Option<VideoFrame>>;// pull a decoded frame
```

This streaming push/pull shape is what keeps peak RSS bounded — the pump pushes
one demuxed sample, drains whatever frames are ready, and never materialises the
whole stream. Implementations may buffer internally (QSV accumulates until it has
a full header) or decode eagerly; the contract only says frames come out of
`decode_next` in display order.

### Dispatch order and the actual tiers

[`create_decoder_on`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L410) calls
[`gpu::detect_gpus()`](#gpu-detection) once (on a build with a GPU feature), then
tries, in order:

1. **NVDEC** (`nvidia` feature) — if an NVIDIA device is present (or matches the
   requested `gpu_index`), the codec is in
   [`nvdec_supports`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L260), and it isn't
   disabled by env-var, return an `NvdecDecoder`. A CUDA/parser init failure
   does not fail construction: `NvdecDecoder::new` returns a decoder that
   reports the error on the first push, which the guard turns into a
   fallback. NVIDIA wins ties because NVDEC is generally lower-latency on the
   standard codec set and is what the fleet is tuned against (comment at
   `create_decoder`).
2. **AMF** (`amd` feature) — first AMD device (or the requested one) +
   [`amf_dec::host_supports`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs#L142), a
   per-process probe of which decoder components this host's AMD GPU actually
   has.
3. **QSV** (`qsv` feature) — first Intel device (or the requested one) +
   [`qsv_dec::supports`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L118).

   An AMF or QSV decoder whose construction fails (no runtime, a context or
   session that will not open) logs a warning and the chain moves on to the
   next tier rather than failing the job. A refusal that comes later — QSV's
   `MFXVideoDECODE_Init` returning `MFX_ERR_UNSUPPORTED` once the header has
   been parsed, for a profile or size the fixed-function block will not take —
   is caught by the late-fallback guard described below.
4. **Native H.264 / HEVC** ([`h26x_sw`](../crates/codec/src/decode/h26x_sw.rs),
   always compiled) — rivet's own decoders, the only software tier for those
   two codecs. Nothing below them takes H.264 or HEVC, so they are not
   wrapped in the guard: a stream they refuse (an `Unsupported` on the
   parameter set — H.264 data partitioning, unequal luma / chroma depths,
   SP/SI outside the Extended profile's shape; HEVC SCC, multi-layer,
   separate colour planes), or a first picture with no pipeline pixel format,
   is an error. `RIVET_DISABLE_H26X=1` skips it, leaving those codecs to the
   hardware tiers. See [Native H.264 / HEVC](#native-h264--hevc--decodeh26x_swrs).
5. **AV1, ProRes, VP8, VP9, MPEG-1 / MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2** — the
   workspace's own decoders, always compiled, one per format, each taking only
   its own codec labels (checked in `create_software_decoder`, ahead of the
   native H.264 / HEVC tier; the label sets do not overlap, so the order
   changes nothing). Nothing below them takes these codecs, so they are not
   wrapped in the guard: a stream one of them cannot decode is an error. See
   [AV1](#av1--decodeav1_swrs), [ProRes](#prores--decodeprores_swrs), [VP8](#vp8--decodevp8_swrs),
   [VP9](#vp9--decodevp9_swrs), [MPEG-1 / MPEG-2](#mpeg-1--mpeg-2--decodempeg2_swrs)
   and [MPEG-4 Part 2](#mpeg-4-part-2--decodempeg4_swrs).
6. Otherwise **hard-fail** with a message naming what each tier covers —
   "NVIDIA GPUs cover h264/h265/vp8/vp9/av1/mpeg2/mpeg4; Intel Arc/Meteor
   Lake+ covers h264/h265/vp9/av1; the native software tiers cover H.264 and
   HEVC to 12-bit 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4, AV1, ProRes, VP8, VP9, MPEG-1/2 and
   MPEG-4 Part 2". With every
   format above in the chain, in practice that means a codec rivet does not
   decode at all.

   A 2026-05-08 directive deleted every CPU decoder (openh264, libde265,
   libvpx, rav1d, …) along with the legacy `FallbackDecoder` GPU→CPU fallover.
   What came back came back deliberately: rav1d for AV1 (the format rivet
   itself produces), openh264 as a narrow gated H.264 tier, and — the reason
   the software story is now different in kind — the native `h26x` decoders, which need nothing from the host, are threaded across
   the machine, and are checked bit-exact against the conformance suites.
   On 2026-10-02 the ProRes, VP8, VP9, MPEG-1 / MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2
   decoders joined them, written the same way, the same day libavcodec (the
   only software decoder those formats had had) left for good; on 2026-10-03
   the workspace's own AV1 decoder replaced rav1d, and with it AV1 joined the
   ungated tier ([decisions.md §39](decisions.md#39-av1-and-every-still-image-codec-are-the-workspaces-own-rav1e-rav1d-and-the-image-crate-are-gone)),
   and openh264, which had sat behind `h26x` as an opt-in H.264 tier
   (`openh264-fallback`) and decoded nothing `h26x` does not, was removed
   ([decisions.md §40](decisions.md#40-openh264-is-gone-h26x-is-the-only-software-h264-decoder)).

**Why hardware first, and loud about software.** The README's whole pitch is
that getting GPU decode right per vendor is the hard part a generic toolbox
leaves to you, and it "quietly falls back to a slow software path when any of
that is wrong." rivet keeps the hardware tiers first and every software
engagement says so at `info`/`warn` — but for H.264, HEVC, AV1, ProRes, VP8,
VP9, MPEG-1 / MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2 a host with no decode silicon now
decodes them natively rather than failing the job.

### Rotation and stills

[`RotatingDecoder`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L151) wraps any decoder
so its frames come out already turned by the container's rotation (90, 180 or
270 clockwise, through `filter::VideoFilter::Rotate`), with `stream_info()`
reporting the swapped dimensions for 90 / 270. Every other angle, 0 included,
returns the inner decoder unchanged. The decode pump, the thumbnail path and
per-title sampling wrap their decoders with it, so no consumer sees an
unrotated frame.

Still images use the same dispatch: an AVIF's coded items go to the AV1
chain and a HEIC's to the HEVC chain (rivet's `image` feature; see
[output-spec.md §11](output-spec.md#11-still-images--modeimage)). The AV1
tier decodes every AV1 layout and depth, which AVIF needs — 4:4:4 is what most
AVIF encoders write — and, being always in the chain, decodes an AVIF in
every `image` build.

### The `DISABLE_*` env knobs

[`nvdec_disabled_for`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L241) (`nvidia` builds) is a debugging
escape hatch: `DISABLE_NVDEC=1` skips NVDEC for every codec, and
`DISABLE_NVDEC_<CODEC>=1` (e.g. `DISABLE_NVDEC_H264`, `DISABLE_NVDEC_AV1`) skips
one codec family. The point is operational — when a specific codec/driver combo
misbehaves on a host (the comment cites a "Blackwell + 4K H.264 silent-stall"),
you can disable just that path and fall through to the next tier without a
rebuild. [`env_flag_truthy`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L225) parses
`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`/`y`/`t` (case-insensitive). `RIVET_DISABLE_H26X` takes
the same values and removes the native H.264 / HEVC tier, for comparing
against the tiers below it. `RIVET_AV1_DECODE_THREAD=0` makes the AV1 tier
decode on the caller's thread rather than its own worker (see
[AV1](#av1--decodeav1_swrs)).

### Shared deinterleave helpers

Two `pub(crate)` helpers convert vendor surface layouts into the crate's packed
planar convention, shared so the GPU backends can't drift (NVDEC's 10-bit P016
path has its own, below):
- [`nv12_planes_to_yuv420p`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L62) — NV12
  (Y plane + interleaved UV, each with its own stride) → packed `[Y | U | V]`.
- [`p010_planes_to_yuv420p10le`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L98) — host
  P010 (10-bit in the **high** bits of each u16) → `Yuv420p10le` (10-bit in the
  **low** bits via `>> 6`).

### Capability introspection

[`decode_backends()`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L285) (the compiled
backends in dispatch order: `nvdec`, `amf`, `qsv`, `h26x`, `prores`, `vp8`,
`vp9`, `mpeg2`, `mpeg4`, `av1`, `openh264`, filtered by feature — the seven
native ones are in every build) and
[`decode_capabilities()`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L323) (which of them
decodes each of H.264, HEVC, VP8, VP9, AV1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and ProRes; every
row lists a software backend in every build, and ProRes lists only
`prores`) back the
`rivet capabilities` CLI command, not the runtime dispatch. The software rows
are listed only for the codecs each tier serves. The AMF and QSV rows are not
static guesses: they come from **runtime hardware probes** —
[`amf_dec::probe_decode_caps`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs#L110)
(one `CreateComponent` per decoder id) and
[`qsv_dec::probe_decode_caps`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L152) (a
oneVPL HW session and `MFXVideoDECODE_Query` per codec) — so the report shows
AMF or QSV decode only on a host where that runtime + adapter actually
initialise.

[`decode_capable_gpu_indices(codec)`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L853)
lists the global GPU indices whose vendor decoder takes `codec` in this build
(honouring the `DISABLE_NVDEC*` knobs) — the candidates `--decode fastest`
benchmarks before pinning the pump to the quickest.

**Notes / gotchas (drift to be aware of).**
- **The `gpu_index` argument is load-bearing for multi-GPU.** `create_decoder`
  (no index) keeps the legacy "first matching adapter" behaviour for one-shot
  callers; the pipeline's per-rung pumps should pass `Some(idx)` so each rung's
  decode session lands on a distinct physical adapter (the doc comment on
  `create_decoder_on` flags that, without it, every QSV session piles onto the
  first Intel card). NVDEC and AMF open the chosen device's `vendor_index`;
  `QsvDecoder::new` takes it but does not use it yet — its
  `MFXInit(MFX_IMPL_HARDWARE_ANY)` lets the runtime pick the adapter.
- **`FallbackDecoder` does not exist**, but late fallback does:
  `HardwareThenSoftware` (in `decode/mod.rs`) wraps a hardware tier so a decoder that accepts construction and then refuses
  the stream is replaced by the next tier, with everything fed so far
  replayed. The guard holds until the decoder has produced a **frame**, not
  until it has accepted a sample: NVDEC's parser reads a sample's last NAL unit
  when the next one arrives, so it refuses an unsupported sequence (10-bit or
  4:4:4 H.264, 4:2:2 HEVC on an RTX 3090) on the second push, and until
  2026-09-18 the guard had already dropped the fallback after the first and the
  job failed. A refusal from a push, from `finish`, from `decode_next`, or a
  stream taken to the end with no frame out, all degrade; the replay is capped
  at 64 MiB. NVDEC surfaces what its callbacks record (`cuvidCreateDecoder`
  failing, a picture that will not decode or map) while it has produced
  nothing, instead of accepting samples and yielding nothing. With no software
  tier for the codec the error names both ("the hardware decoder refused this
  stream (…), and no software decoder can take it: …"). Once a decoder has
  produced a frame the guard is dropped: a failure on sample nine thousand is a
  stream error, not a capability question.
  `create_decoder_on` wires NVDEC → AMF → QSV → prores / vp8 / vp9 / mpeg2 /
  mpeg4 / av1 / h26x (one per codec) → hard-fail.
  *(Historical note: an FFmpeg tier used to be listed here as "present but not
  wired" — capability-listed and never constructed — which is why it was removed
  outright on 2026-08-12. It was restored, constructed, behind an opt-in
  `ffmpeg` feature on 2026-08-14, and removed for good on 2026-10-02: rivet
  takes no dependency on FFmpeg in any build.)*

## GPU decode backends

All three hardware backends share the same shape: `dlopen` the vendor runtime,
stand up a context/session, drive it through the `Decoder` trait, and copy decoded
surfaces back to host memory in `Yuv420p` / `Yuv420p10le`. They differ in the
vendor API and how much the dev box could verify.

### NVDEC (NVIDIA) — `decode/nvdec/`

**What.** [`nvdec/`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/mod.rs) loads `libcuda` +
`libnvcuvid` at runtime and drives the CUVID stateless-parser API:
`cuInit` → `cuCtxCreate` → `cuvidCreateVideoParser`, then per sample
`cuCtxPushCurrent` + `cuvidParseVideoData` + `cuCtxPopCurrent`. Three parser
callbacks do the work: the sequence callback creates the decoder + validates the
format, the decode callback runs `cuvidDecodePicture`, and the display callback
maps the frame (`cuvidMapVideoFrame` + `cuMemcpy2D`) and pushes NV12/P016 bytes
into a shared collector. The production path is the **streaming**
[`NvdecStreamingDecoder`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/streaming.rs#L113) ([engaged from `NvdecDecoder::new`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/eager.rs#L75)):
each `push_sample` parses just-pushed bytes, and the display callback enqueues
into a bounded `VecDeque<DecodedFrame>` that `decode_next` drains one at a time.

**Why streaming, not eager.** The eager `new_with_pts` constructor (retained as
library/test code) buffers the entire decoded run in RAM before draining — fine
for smoke tests, catastrophic for a 15-minute clip. The streaming decoder bounds
peak heap to roughly one bitstream sample plus a reorder-window-sized queue
(≤ B-pyramid depth ≈ 16 frames); CUVID's DPB lives GPU-side, not in RSS.

**Why the obsessive ABI pinning.** This file is where the project's "we own the
vendor ABI" tax is paid in full. The FFI structs mirror NVIDIA Video Codec SDK
12.2, and a *too-small* Rust struct lets the driver write past our allocation into
adjacent state — surfacing as a `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` on long streams or,
worse, silent wrong frames. So:
- Compile-time size assertions pin the exact layout: `CUVIDPARSERPARAMS` at
  [136 bytes](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/ffi.rs#L457), `CUVIDPICPARAMS` at
  [4280](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/ffi.rs#L485) (its `codec_specific` region is
  the SDK's 4096-byte `CodecReserved[1024]` envelope), `CUVIDPARSERDISPINFO`,
  `CUVIDDECODECAPS`, and `CUVIDSOURCEDATAPACKET` *per platform* (the `c_ulong`
  width differs Windows vs Linux — [24 vs 32 bytes](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/ffi.rs#L502)).
  The comment block lists the real bugs this caught: the parser-params 80→136 fix
  and the pic-params 2048→4280 fix, both of which had produced the segfault-hunt
  class of corruption.
- **Per-codec "shape witness" structs** ([H264/HEVC/AV1/VP9/VP8/MPEG2/MPEG4](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/ffi.rs#L260-L389))
  are dead-code mirrors that exist *only* so a `const_assert!` proves each codec's
  pic-params variant fits in the 4096-byte envelope. They're never used at
  runtime; they're a tripwire so a future SDK that grows one variant fails
  compilation instead of silently overflowing the parser state and reproducing the
  original segfault on a different code path.

**Typed rejects.** [`validate_format`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/convert.rs#L46)
is a pure function (unit-testable without a GPU) that turns the CUVID-reported
chroma/bit-depth into a typed [`NvdecError`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/mod.rs#L74):
`UnsupportedChroma` (only 4:2:0 passes; monochrome/4:2:2/4:4:4 reject),
`UnsupportedPixelFormat` (>12-bit), `UnsupportedByHardware` (per-GPU caps). Why
typed: a reviewer note records that these used to surface as an opaque "NVDEC
produced no frames: <string>", and the pipeline couldn't tell "4:2:2 unsupported"
(a format we'll never decode) from "driver OOM" (transient) — the typed variant
keeps a fallback/abort decision explainable via `downcast_ref::<NvdecError>()`.

**The frame is the display area, not the coded surface.**
[`output_geometry`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/convert.rs#L115) works out,
from the parser's `CUVIDEOFORMAT`, the coded (padded) surface and the display
rectangle inside it — H.264 frame cropping, the HEVC conformance window, the
AV1 / VP9 frame size — and hands the rectangle to `cuvidCreateDecoder` as its
`display_area`, so frames come out at the stream's display size. A 640x360
stream is coded 640x368 and 1080p is coded 1088; a 368-row frame resampled
into a 360-row rung was a vertical squash that cost 20 dB on every job decoded
through NVDEC. If the driver reports no usable display area, the padded
surface is used and a warning logged.

**Notes / gotchas.**
- 10-bit comes back as **P016** (10 bits in the high bits of each u16);
  [`deinterleave_p016_to_yuv420p10le`](../crates/codec/src/decode/nvdec/convert.rs#L173)
  does the `>> 6` normalize + UV split and handles odd dimensions. 12-bit shares
  the path (the shift clips to 10-bit range, which is what downstream expects).
- **VP8 / VP9 on an RTX 3090** (2026-10-03, [`tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs`](../crates/codec/tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs),
  one stream per process): H.264 bit-exact against `h26x` (the first
  hardware run since the `CUVID_CREATE_PREFER_CUVID` fix); VP9 profile 0 / 2
  bit-exact on every WebM project 4:2:0 vector through the
  [VP9 guard](#the-vp9-guard--decodevp9_hw_guardrs); VP8 bit-exact on rivet's
  own clip and the 16 even-sized RFC 6386 comprehensive vectors. An
  odd-sized picture is not handed to NVDEC — the post-processor's target must
  be even, and VP9 (whose coded size CUVID reports as the odd picture size)
  and VP8 both came back resampled or short — so it goes to rivet's own
  decoder.
- **VP8 / VP9 go to the parser one frame per packet.** The guide (4.1.2):
  `CUVID_PKT_ENDOFPICTURE` "MUST be set when packet contains exactly one
  frame", and of a packet with more than one frame "parser will trigger
  decode callback for first frame data. Rest of the NALU will get dropped".
  It says nothing of VP9 superframes, so a superframe is split
  (`convert::split_frames`) and each frame goes as its own packet with
  `ENDOFPICTURE`; every VP8 packet is marked too.
- **`CUVIDDECODECAPS` is 88 bytes.** The mirror stopped at `reserved3[8]`
  (80) where NVIDIA's header has the histogram fields and `reserved3[10]`, so
  every `cuvidGetDecoderCaps` wrote 8 bytes past it; fixed 2026-10-03, the
  layout pinned by offset asserts.
- `CUVID_CREATE_PREFER_CUVID` is `cudaVideoCreate_PreferCUVID` = `0x04`
  (cuviddec.h: "Use dedicated video engines directly", with `_Default` the
  "most optimized" pair), asked for over DXVA and the CUDA-based decoder. Until
  2026-10-03 the constant held `0x01`, which the header names
  `_PreferCUDA` ("requires valid vidLock object for multi-threading", and no
  `vidLock` was set); corrected from the header, not yet re-run on NVIDIA
  hardware.
- The library handles are stored **last** on the struct so Rust's source-order
  drop tears down decoder/parser/context before unloading the `.so`/`.dll` whose
  fn pointers they reference.

### QSV (Intel) — `decode/qsv_dec.rs`

**What.** [`qsv_dec.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs) `dlopen`s
`libvpl` and drives oneVPL: a session from the 2.x dispatcher (`MFXLoad` →
`Impl = HARDWARE` filter → `MFXCreateSession` on the adapter; `MFXInit(HW)`
only when the dispatcher finds nothing) →
[`MFXVideoDECODE_DecodeHeader`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L269) on the
first buffered samples → `MFXVideoDECODE_Init` → per sample
[`DecodeFrameAsync` + `SyncOperation`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L384),
then [read the surface](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L444) into a
`VideoFrame`. Decodes H.264/HEVC/AV1/VP9 (8-bit NV12 and 10-bit P010). It reuses
the exact `mfx*` struct layouts from [`qsv_ffi`](#the-qsv_ffi-abi-layer), shared
with the QSV encoder.

**Why the internal-allocation path.** `DecodeFrameAsync` runs with
`surface_work = NULL`, which engages oneVPL 2.x **internal surface allocation**;
the decoder then reads the returned surface through its `mfxFrameSurfaceInterface`
vtable (`Map` to access planes, `Release` when done). The comments record that the
*external* work-surface pool "never produced frames on the iHD 2.x runtime" — this
is the path that actually works (and the one shiguredo_vpl uses).

**Why trust DecodeHeader's format.** `try_init` deliberately does **not** force
fourcc/bit-depth/shift — it lets the iHD driver report NV12 for 8-bit and P010 for
10-bit (Main10) and derives `ten_bit` from the returned fourcc. The comment notes
that forcing those fields ourselves made HEVC Main10 `Init` fail.

**Notes / gotchas.**
- [`read_surface`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L444) emits the **crop
  (display)** dims, not the coded dims — 1080p codes as 1088 (16-aligned), and
  feeding 1088-tall frames into a 1080-configured encoder fails
  `EncodeFrameAsync`. `try_init` fills a zero crop from the coded size and
  aligns the surface to 16 (32 rows for interlaced content).
- **Sessions come from the dispatcher, on the adapter asked for.** Until
  2026-10-03 the decoder used `MFXInit(MFX_IMPL_HARDWARE_ANY)`, the 1.x entry
  point, which takes no adapter — and on the Intel CI runner (Arc A750) it
  reached a runtime that answered every `MFXVideoDECODE_Init` with
  `MFX_ERR_UNSUPPORTED`, H.264 and HEVC included; the dispatch fell back to
  software each time, so nothing failed and nothing was decoded on the card.
  Through the dispatcher, as the encoder has always opened its sessions, the
  same runner decodes on the card.
- Plane pointers are valid only between `Map`/`Unmap`; the read copies out inside
  that window.
- **Hardware-verified on a 3× Intel Arc box** (A310 / A380 / A750, oneVPL 2.16 /
  iHD): H.264, HEVC, VP9, and AV1 each decode end-to-end (transcode to AV1 on a
  qsv-only build, with the QSV decoder engaged). VP9 on the CI runner's Arc
  A750 ([`tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs`](../crates/codec/tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs)):
  rivet's own profile 0 / 2 clips and the WebM project's 4:2:0 vectors
  bit-exact against rivet's own decoder through the
  [VP9 guard](#the-vp9-guard--decodevp9_hw_guardrs). VP8 is not wired: Intel's
  tables give no VP8 decode on DG2.

**Capability probe.** [`probe_decode_caps`](../crates/codec/src/decode/qsv_dec.rs#L152)
is the decode side of `rivet capabilities`: it opens one HW `MFXInit` session and
`MFXVideoDECODE_Query`s each codec. iHD's Query is *advisory* — on the Arc box it
returns an error for every codec it nonetheless decodes — so a successful
`MFXInit(HW)` is the load-bearing signal: when Query yields nothing, the probe
reports the build's codec list (the runtime is usable) rather than claim no
decode; a non-empty Query result is trusted as-is (to drop, say, AV1 on a pre-Arc
iGPU). It returns empty on a non-Intel host, so the report shows QSV decode only
where it actually runs. This is wired into
[`decode_capabilities`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mod.rs#L323).

### AMF (AMD) — `decode/amf_dec.rs`

**What.** [`amf_dec.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs) drives the AMF
runtime through the COM-style vtables mirrored in
[`amf_ffi.rs`](../crates/codec/src/amf_ffi.rs) and the runtime / context
lifecycle in [`amf_runtime.rs`](../crates/codec/src/amf_runtime.rs), both shared
with the AMF encoder: `AmfRuntime::open` (dlopen → `AMFInit` → `CreateContext` →
a context bound to the chosen AMD GPU) → `CreateComponent(<decoder id>)` →
`Init(NV12 | P010, w, h)`, then per sample `AllocBuffer(HOST)` + copy the
Annex-B access unit → `SetPts` → `SubmitInput` → loop `QueryOutput` → `QueryInterface(IID_AMFSurface)` →
`Convert(HOST)` → read the NV12 / P010 planes into `Yuv420p` / `Yuv420p10le`.
`finish` is `Drain`, then `QueryOutput` polled to `AMF_EOF` (bounded at 10 s).
Decodes H.264 / HEVC / VP9 / AV1, as far as the GPU has the block.

**`SubmitInput` follows the decode guide (§2.3).** `AMF_INPUT_FULL` and
`AMF_DECODER_NO_FREE_SURFACES` suspend submission: drain output, submit the
same buffer again (bounded). `AMF_REPEAT` means "the currently submitted
buffer has more than one frame and needs another SubmitInput() call ...
invoked with NULL", and gets exactly that. Until 2026-10-03 it was handled
like `AMF_INPUT_FULL` — the same buffer resubmitted up to 64 times, a VP9
superframe's frames fed to the hardware again and again — and a run of the
VP9 test vectors through it coincided with video-engine timeouts on the AMD
iGPU (LiveKernelEvent 141 / a2000002). `AMF_RESOLUTION_CHANGED` (26, "client
needs to Drain/Terminate/Init") and any other failure end the decoder:
nothing more is submitted to it. The fix applies to every codec AMF decodes
(an H.264 / HEVC / AV1 buffer holding more than one frame too).

**What this host decodes is asked, not assumed.**
[`probe_decode_caps`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs#L110) opens one
context on the first AMD GPU and tries `CreateComponent` for each decoder id
once per process; [`host_supports`](../crates/codec/src/decode/amf_dec.rs#L142)
answers from that, for the dispatch and for `rivet capabilities`. A VCN
without an AV1 block is not offered AV1.

**Multi-adapter routing (Windows).** AMF's `InitDX11(null)` lets the runtime
create its device on **DXGI adapter 0** — which on a mixed host (an NVIDIA card in
slot 0 + an AMD GPU elsewhere) is the wrong, non-AMD adapter, and init fails. So
on Windows we build the D3D11 device ourselves on the chosen AMD adapter:
[`amf_device::create_amd_d3d11_device`](../crates/codec/src/amf_device.rs)
enumerates adapters via DXGI, finds the `vendor_index`-th `0x1002` one, and
`D3D11CreateDevice`s it with `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_VIDEO_SUPPORT` — then hands that
device to `InitDX11(dev, AMF_DX11_1)` (`AmfRuntime` keeps it alive for the
context's lifetime). On Linux the context is `QueryInterface(AMFContext1)` →
`InitVulkan(null)`, which picks the first AMD GPU (a non-zero `vendor_index` is
logged as a warning). See [GPU detection](#gpu-detection) for how a global
index maps to a vendor-local adapter.

**`QueryOutput` is read by its data pointer, not its result code.** After
`Drain`, the UVD decoder on this driver hands back the frames still in flight
tagged `AMF_REPEAT` *with a non-null buffer*, and only the last as `AMF_OK`;
treating `AMF_REPEAT` as "nothing yet" lost the tail of every stream (58 of 60
frames measured). The drain takes a frame whenever the buffer is non-null with
`AMF_OK` or `AMF_REPEAT`. AMD's AMF API Reference (`AMFComponent::QueryOutput`,
SDK `amf/doc/AMF_API_Reference.md`) makes `AMF_REPEAT` "retry", not an error,
and already warns that `AMF_OK` can come with a null `ppData`; so the pointer,
not the code, says whether a sample came back, and `AMF_EOF` ends the drain.

**Verified on hardware** (2026-10-03, Ryzen 9 9950X iGPU): H.264 (with and
without B pictures), HEVC 8-bit and HEVC Main 10 decode byte-for-byte equal
to the native `h26x` decoders (themselves bit-exact on the JVT / JCT-VC
conformance suites), and AV1 to rav1d, on clips the test makes with rivet's
own encoders (the test now compares AV1 with rivet's own `av1` decoder and
makes its clip with rivet's own AV1 encoder; not yet re-run on the AMD box)
([`tests/amf_decode_pixels.rs`](../crates/codec/tests/amf_decode_pixels.rs)).
VP9 is **opt-in** (`RIVET_AMF_VP9=1`; see [the guard](#the-vp9-guard--decodevp9_hw_guardrs)
for why). With it (2026-10-03, same iGPU, [`tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs`](../crates/codec/tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs)):
rivet's own profile 0 and profile 2 clips and the WebM project's 4:2:0
8 / 10-bit vectors, bit-exact against rivet's own decoder through the VP9
guard (see [The VP9 guard](#the-vp9-guard--decodevp9_hw_guardrs)); the
pictures come out at the surface's plane size, cropped to the header's.

**Notes / gotchas.**
- `gpu_index` selects the AMD adapter on Windows (via the D3D11 routing
  above), **not** "adapter 0 unconditionally" as older comments claimed.
- A failed `InitDX11` / `InitVulkan` releases the context and returns an error
  naming the adapter ("… this GPU is not one the AMF runtime drives"); the
  dispatch logs it and tries the next tier, and `--decode fastest` skips that
  GPU instead of taking the process down.

### The VP9 guard — `decode/vp9_hw_guard.rs`

**What.** Every hardware VP9 decoder (NVDEC, AMF, QSV) is built behind a
[`Vp9HardwareGuard`](../crates/codec/src/decode/vp9_hw_guard.rs). It reads
each packet's uncompressed headers ([`vp9_header`](../crates/codec/src/vp9_header.rs),
written from the VP9 spec §6.2 as far as `segmentation_enabled`, following
`frame_size_with_refs` through the reference slots) *before* the decoder sees
the packet, and keeps the packets since the last key frame. A packet the
vendor's decoder is not trusted with goes to rivet's own decoder instead: the
hardware is drained of every picture it owes, the kept packets are replayed
into `vp9_sw`, the pictures the hardware already returned are dropped, and the
stream carries on in software. VP9's reconstruction is exact, so the pictures
either side of the switch are the ones a single decoder would have made; the
guard renumbers output timestamps 0, 1, 2, … across it. A hardware failure
mid-stream switches the same way instead of ending the job.

**Never handed to the hardware**, whatever the vendor: anything but profile 0
/ 2 4:2:0; a depth other than the one the decoder was set up for; a first key
frame whose size is not the container's (AMF is initialised at the
container's size, and a WebM / IVF header can understate the stream); a size
outside the vendor's documented range — AMF 16x16 to 8192x8192 (AMD's AMF
wiki: "VP9 8,10b: 8K" on every VCN), QSV up to 16384x16384 (Intel
media-driver `media_features.md`), NVDEC 128x128 to 8192x8192 (NVDEC
Programming Guide). Hardware output is cropped to the header's frame size: a
surface rounds an odd size up (AMF returns 352x288 for 351x287).

**Trusted per vendor** ([`Vp9HwPolicy`](../crates/codec/src/decode/vp9_hw_guard.rs)),
on evidence from [`tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs`](../crates/codec/tests/hw_vpx_decode.rs)
only: `show_existing_frame`, frame-size changes (an inter frame predicting
from scaled references), `error_resilient_mode`, segmentation, `intra_only`
frames. A key frame at a new size is not a switch: the guard drains the
hardware decoder and builds a fresh one at the new size (AMF's
`AMF_RESOLUTION_CHANGED` asks for exactly that: "Drain/Terminate/Init").

What each vendor's decoder is trusted with, and why (bare decoder, one
stream per process; on the local GPUs the Application and System event logs
were checked after every run):

| | AMF (opt-in, see below) | QSV (Arc A750, CI) | NVDEC (RTX 3090) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `error_resilient_mode` | refused: exact in the vector runs, never tested alone | trusted: exact | trusted: exact, tested alone |
| segmentation | **refused**: wrong from the first segmented frame | trusted: exact | trusted: exact, tested alone (6 vectors) |
| `show_existing_frame` | **refused**: no picture comes back | trusted: exact | **refused**: no picture comes back |
| `intra_only` | **refused**: `AMF_RESOLUTION_CHANGED` | trusted: exact (one vector) | refused: its one vector also uses `show_existing_frame` |
| superframe of more than 2 frames | **refused**: video-engine timeout | trusted up to 8: exact | refused (untested; split one frame per packet regardless) |
| inter-frame size change | **refused**: decoded at the first size | **refused**: pictures stop or go wrong | refused: never given to the bare decoder (created once, at the first size) |
| odd width / height | cropped from the surface: exact | exact (after the NV12 chroma fix) | **refused**: resampled to the even size |
| key-frame size change | restart | restart | restart |

Through the guard, as dispatched: QSV and NVDEC decode every one of the
WebM project's profile 0 / 2 4:2:0 vectors (343 and 341 read) bit-exact
against rivet's own decoder; AMF did on the 251 run before the stop below.

**AMF is opt-in for VP9 (`RIVET_AMF_VP9=1`).** On the Ryzen 9 9950X iGPU the
vector runs drove the video engine into timeouts (LiveKernelEvent 141 /
a2000002): through the `SubmitInput` protocol bug and frames larger than
the decoder was set up for (both fixed), then on an eight-frame superframe
(now refused), and then once on a run in which the decoder had been handed a
single ordinary key frame — nothing the guard reads explains that one. So
the dispatcher does not offer AMF a VP9 stream unless asked; H.264 / HEVC /
AV1 are unaffected.

### Native H.264 / HEVC — `decode/h26x_sw.rs`

**What.** [`h26x_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/h26x_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/h26x`](../crates/h26x/README.md): two decoders written from the ITU-T
specifications. H.264: Baseline through High 4:4:4 Predictive and the Intra
profiles — frames, field pictures and MBAFF, 4:0:0 / 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 at
8–14-bit, separate colour planes, lossless, CAVLC/CABAC, B-frames,
temporal/spatial direct, weighted prediction, 8x8 transform, scaling matrices,
MMCO/long-term, PCM, slice groups (FMO), ASO, and the Extended profile's SP /
SI slices. HEVC: Main / Main 10 / Main 12 and the format range extensions
(4:0:0 / 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4, 8–16-bit, unequal luma / chroma depths) with
WPP, tiles, dependent slices, SAO, PCM, transform skip, scaling lists, TMVP,
weighted prediction. The crate README has the full supported / refused table.
Both are bit-exact against the conformance suites (JVT AVCv1 + FRExt: all
204; JVT professional profiles: all 38; JCT-VC HEVC_v1: 147/147; RExt: all
49) and both are threaded — pictures in flight concurrently with
reference-progress waits, plus wavefront rows / tiles inside a picture for
HEVC — with SIMD kernels picked at run time (SSE2 through AVX2, plus AVX-512
for some HEVC kernels, on x86-64; NEON, plus dot product where present, on
AArch64). `H26X_THREADS`, `H26X_INFLIGHT`, `H26X_NO_SIMD`, `H26X_MAX_SIMD`
tune it; the crate README lists the rest.

**Where.** First among the software tiers for the two codecs, below every
hardware tier. It is always compiled — pure Rust, no toolchain — so it is
present in every build, and it handles the profiles that actually arrive. It
is the only software decoder for either codec: a stream it refuses is decoded
by nothing in software. (openh264 sat behind it until 2026-10-03; it decoded
a strict subset — progressive 8-bit 4:2:0 — and is gone, §40 of
[decisions.md](decisions.md).) `RIVET_DISABLE_H26X=1` takes it out of the chain.

**Output.** 4:2:0 as `Yuv420p` / `Yuv420p10le` / `Yuv420p12le`, 4:2:2 and
4:4:4 as `Yuv422p*` / `Yuv444p*` at the same three depths; 9-bit is widened
to 10 and 11-bit to 12. Monochrome travels as 4:2:0 with grey chroma. Depths
above 12 (H.264's 13 / 14-bit professional profiles, HEVC RExt 16-bit) and
pictures whose luma and chroma depths differ have no pipeline pixel format and
are refused by name. Frames come out in output (POC) order, numbered from
zero, like the AV1 tier.

**Refusals.** An `h26x::Error::Unsupported` is returned from `push_sample`
before any picture exists — on the parameter set for H.264, at the first slice
where the SPS is checked — and the tier guard hands the stream on. A bitstream
error before the first picture is likewise a refusal, so the next tier gets a
go; after it, errors are logged and skipped, matching the other software tiers
(a stream with a damaged NAL is not a failed job).

### ProRes — `decode/prores_sw.rs`

**What.** [`prores_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/prores_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/prores`](../crates/prores/README.md) (a git submodule: the
[rivet-prores](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-prores) repository,
where it is changed), a decoder written clean-room from SMPTE RDD 36:2022 —
no other ProRes implementation was read or run. The six profiles (Proxy
`apco`, LT `apcs`, 422 `apcn`, HQ `apch`, 4444 `ap4h`, 4444 XQ `ap4x`) share
one syntax, so one decoder serves all of them: 4:2:2 and 4:4:4, progressive
and interlaced frames (two field pictures, either first, woven), loaded
quantisation matrices, 8- and 16-bit alpha. It is checked against frames
assembled by hand from RDD 36's syntax tables, the IEEE 1180 IDCT
qualification, round trips through the crate's own encoder, and frames from
Apple's encoder (a public 422 HQ interlaced sample); the crate README has
the figures.

**Where.** The `prores` label (what the MP4 / MOV demuxer gives every ProRes
track) and the six profile fourccs. No hardware tier takes ProRes, so this is
the only decoder for it; always compiled, no feature, no env knob.

**Output.** ProRes is intra-only: one MOV sample in, one frame out, in order,
numbered from zero. 4:2:2 comes out as `Yuv422p10le` and 4:4:4 as
`Yuv444p12le`, the depths the profiles are defined at; the colour matrix is
the frame header's (BT.709, BT.601 or BT.2020), else the stream's. An alpha
plane is dropped: the pipeline has none.

**Refusals.** What RDD 36 reserves — bitstream version 2 and above, the
reserved chroma and interlace codes, quantisation indices 0 and 225–255 —
and malformed frames are errors from `push_sample`; nothing sits below this
tier to take the stream instead. The crate's encoder is rivet's ProRes encoder (see [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)).

### VP8 — `decode/vp8_sw.rs`

**What.** [`vp8_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/vp8_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/vp8`](../crates/vp8/README.md) (a git submodule: the
[rivet-vp8](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-vp8) repository), a
decoder written clean-room from RFC 6386's prose and tables — not the
reference decoder source the RFC attaches, not libvpx, not any other. All of
VP8: key and inter frames, hidden frames, every intra and inter mode, split
motion vectors, golden / altref references, segmentation, both loop
filters, versions 0–3. Bit-exact on all 18 comprehensive test vectors (872 of
872 frames), which the crate commits with their MD5s.

**Where.** The software tier for VP8 (`vp8`, `vp08`), behind NVDEC; a host
without NVDEC, or one whose NVDEC refuses the stream, decodes it here.

**Output.** One sample (an IVF frame, a WebM block) in, at most one frame
out: a hidden frame (an altref) updates references and produces nothing.
`Yuv420p`, BT.601 (VP8 has no other colour space), numbered from zero. The
key frame's upscaling codes are not applied — pictures come out at the coded
size, as RFC 6386 leaves scaling to the player.

**Refusals.** The two things RFC 6386 reserves (bitstream versions above 3,
colour space 1) and malformed frames are errors from `push_sample`. The
crate's encoder is rivet's VP8 encoder (see [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)).

### VP9 — `decode/vp9_sw.rs`

**What.** [`vp9_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/vp9_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/vp9`](../crates/vp9/README.md) (a git submodule: the
[rivet-vp9](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-vp9) repository), a
decoder written clean-room from the *VP9 Bitstream & Decoding Process
Specification* (v0.6 / v0.7) — no libvpx, no libavcodec. Profiles 0–3 (8-,
10- and 12-bit; 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:0, 4:4:4), every frame type, superframes,
scaled references, tiles, lossless. Bit-exact on 352 of the 353 public VP9
test vectors it was run on (the one failure is a profile 1 stream whose MD5
file predates the final syntax; the crate README explains it). It is
single-threaded scalar Rust: about 23 frames/s at 1920x1080 on one core, by
the crate's own measurement.

**Where.** The software tier for VP9 (`vp9`, `vp09`), behind NVDEC, AMF and
QSV.

**Output.** One sample (a frame or a superframe) in, at most one frame out —
a superframe shows its last frame, as the reference decoder does; a hidden
frame shows nothing. 8 / 10 / 12-bit 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 map to
`Yuv420p*` / `Yuv422p*` / `Yuv444p*` at the same depth; the colour matrix is
the stream's (BT.709, BT.2020, or BT.601 for BT.601 / SMPTE 170 / SMPTE 240),
else the stream info's. Numbered from zero.

**Refusals.** 4:4:0 (no pipeline pixel format) and RGB-coded streams are
refused by name on the first such frame; a corrupt frame is an error from
`push_sample` (the crate has no concealment). The crate's encoder is rivet's
VP9 encoder (profiles 0 and 2 here) (see [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)).

### MPEG-1 / MPEG-2 — `decode/mpeg2_sw.rs`

**What.** [`mpeg2_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mpeg2_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/mpeg2`](../crates/mpeg2/README.md) (a git submodule: the
[rivet-mpeg2](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-mpeg2) repository), a
decoder written clean-room from ITU-T H.262 (and, for the few MPEG-1 points
H.262 only summarises, ISO/IEC 11172-2) — no libavcodec, libmpeg2 or MSSG
code. Main and 4:2:2 profiles at any level: frame and field pictures,
dual-prime, 16×8, both scans, downloaded matrices, every DC precision,
sequence changes mid-stream; MPEG-1 video including D-pictures. All 57
main- and 4:2:2-profile streams of the ISO/IEC 13818-4 conformance suite
(1,972 frames; nine of the streams are MPEG-1) decode without an error, and the two
streams whose traces carry reconstructed samples match them exactly.

**Where.** The software tier for `mpeg2`, `mpeg2video`, `m2v`, `mpeg1`,
`mpeg1video` and `m1v`, behind NVDEC (which takes the `mpeg2` labels only).

**Output.** Samples are elementary-stream bytes in any chunking; frames come
out in display order (the decoder reorders), the one it holds back drained
at `finish`. `Yuv420p` or `Yuv422p`, 8-bit, cropped to `horizontal_size` ×
`vertical_size`; the colour matrix is the sequence display extension's when there is
one, else the stream info's. Numbered from zero. 3:2 pulldown flags are
reported by the crate, not applied.

**Refusals.** The scalable extensions, 4:4:4 and pictures larger than 4096 ×
4096 are refused by the crate; a damaged slice is an error from
`push_sample`. The crate's Main Profile encoder is rivet's MPEG-2 encoder
(see [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)).

### MPEG-4 Part 2 — `decode/mpeg4_sw.rs`

**What.** [`mpeg4_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/mpeg4_sw.rs) drives
[`crates/mpeg4`](../crates/mpeg4/README.md) (a git submodule: the
[rivet-mpeg4](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-mpeg4) repository), a
decoder written clean-room from ISO/IEC 14496-2 and, for the short video
header, ITU-T H.263 — no libavcodec, Xvid, DivX or reference-software code.
Simple Profile and Advanced Simple Profile (B-VOPs, quarter-sample motion,
global motion compensation, interlaced field DCT and field prediction), DivX
packed bitstreams, and H.263 baseline pictures. Every VOP of the 23 real
encoders' streams it was checked on parses to its stuffing, except where the
files themselves are cut or damaged; there is no reference output for them,
so reconstruction was checked by eye (the crate README says how).

**Where.** The software tier for `mpeg4`, `mp4v`, `mpeg4part2`, `xvid` and
`divx`, behind NVDEC.

**Output.** The decoder configures itself from the VOL header in the stream
— as AVI carries it, the one container whose demuxer labels MPEG-4 Part 2
today. Samples are bitstream bytes in any chunking; frames come out in
display order, with what B-VOP reordering holds back drained at `finish`.
`Yuv420p`, 8-bit, with the stream info's colour matrix (the bitstream states
none the adapter reads). Numbered from zero. Damage inside a VOP is
concealed by the crate (the macroblocks up to the next video packet are
copied from the reference) rather than failing the job.

**Refusals.** Reversible VLCs, arbitrary shape, scalability, NEWPRED,
reduced-resolution VOPs, `not_8_bit`, OBMC, the Studio and FGS object types,
static sprites, four-point GMC, field direct mode, and H.263's optional modes
and PLUSPTYPE are refused by name; header errors are errors from `push_sample`. The crate's
encoder is rivet's MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder (see [codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)).

### AV1 — `decode/av1_sw.rs`

**What.** [`av1_sw.rs`](../crates/codec/src/decode/av1_sw.rs) drives the
workspace's own AV1 decoder, [`crates/av1`](../crates/av1/README.md) (a git
submodule, the rivet-av1 repository), written clean-room from the AV1
Bitstream & Decoding Process Specification. It implements the whole
specification and is bit-exact on all 244 AOM test vectors and all 3,015
Argon conformance streams. It is always compiled and always in the chain,
behind NVDEC, AMF and QSV, like the other native decoders: there is no
feature to turn it on (`rav1d-fallback`, the switch for rav1d, which it
replaced on 2026-10-03, is kept as a no-op). It decodes every layout and
depth AV1 defines: 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 at 8, 10 and 12 bits, as the same
planar formats the native HEVC decoder emits, with monochrome (an AVIF's
alpha plane, a greyscale still) as 4:2:0 with neutral chroma, and film grain
applied as the specification's output process does. Frames are numbered in
output order from zero.

**Throughput, and its threads.** The decoder decodes the tiles of a frame in
parallel and runs its post-filters (loop filter, CDEF, loop restoration) in
bands on several threads, with AVX2 (x86-64) or NEON (aarch64) in its
hottest kernels — the inverse transforms, the inter prediction filters, the
loop filter and CDEF — each bit-exact with its scalar version: on the
encoder's own 720p / 1080p output about 60-70 megapixels a second on one
thread and 75-115 with four (the crate's README has the figures; before,
single-threaded scalar, about 26). The adapter gives each decoder
`decode_threads()` threads — `RIVET_AV1_DECODE_THREADS`, else up to four —
and also takes the decode off the caller's thread: each decoder runs on a
worker thread of its own, up to three temporal units ahead of the caller
(`IN_FLIGHT`), so the pipeline's colour conversion, scaling and encoding
overlap the decode rather than waiting for it. `RIVET_AV1_DECODE_THREAD=0`
decodes on the caller's thread instead.

**Colour.** The sequence header's colour description (primaries, transfer,
matrix, range) and the HDR10 metadata OBUs a stream carries (mastering
display, content light level) replace what the container said in the
decoder's `stream_info().color_metadata`, in the pipeline's units, as frames
come out. The throughput figure is measured by
`cargo test -p rivet-codec --release --features av1-sw-fallback --test
software_av1_roundtrip -- --ignored --nocapture throughput_at_720p`
([testing.md](testing.md)).

**Why it exists.** A CPU-only host must be able to read back AV1, the format
rivet itself produces — that is what makes a round-trip test runnable in CI
— and it matters on GPU hosts too: NVDEC gained AV1 in Ampere while NVENC
only got it in Ada, so a host can encode AV1 in hardware and have no way to
decode it. AVIF input needs it as well. Owning it took the last third-party
video decoder (rav1d, a port of dav1d) out of the build, and the NASM its
assembly wanted ([decisions.md §39](decisions.md#39-av1-and-every-still-image-codec-are-the-workspaces-own-rav1e-rav1d-and-the-image-crate-are-gone)).

## AC-3 / E-AC-3 decoder

**What.** [`crates/ac3`](../crates/ac3/README.md) (the `ac3` crate, a git
submodule: the [rivet-ac3](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-ac3)
repository, where it is changed) is the workspace's own pure-Rust Dolby
Digital / Digital Plus decoder, written from ATSC A/52:2018.
[`audio/decode/ac3.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/ac3.rs) adapts it
as `Ac3Decoder`, reached through `audio::create_decoder("ac3" | "eac3")` and
the job layer's decodable list (so 5.1 AC-3 / E-AC-3 → Opus 5.1 goes through
the normal decode → `channelmap` → Opus path). Files, under
[`crates/ac3/src/`](../crates/ac3/src/lib.rs):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tables.rs` | Every normative table — Tables 5.18, 7.6–7.16, 7.18–7.23, 7.33, E2.10–E2.12, E3.1/E3.2/E3.6/E3.13/E3.14 and the VQ codebooks E4.1–E4.7 — transcribed from the spec PDF (`pdftotext -layout`, `pdftoppm` for the pages that matter), the PDF page on each doc comment, and a test per table that re-reads spot values off the rendered page plus a checksum. The KBD window is also derived analytically and matched to Table 7.33 to five decimals. |
| `bits.rs` | MSB-first reader. A read past the frame is an error, not zero padding: it means the side information was mis-parsed, and zeros would turn that into plausible garbage. |
| `bitalloc.rs` | §7.2.2 in the spec's fixed-point integer arithmetic (fbw / LFE / coupling initialisations, delta bit allocation) plus the E-AC-3 `hebap` lookup. Must be bit-exact with the encoder or the mantissa field widths diverge. |
| `imdct.rs` | §7.9.4 as the spec writes it — pre-twiddle, N/4- or N/8-point complex IFFT, post-twiddle, window, de-interleave, overlap-add — with a radix-2 FFT standing in for the O(N²) sum (a test checks the two agree). |
| `decoder.rs` | `syncinfo` / `bsi` (AC-3 Table 5.2, E-AC-3 Table E1.2), `audfrm`, `audblk`, exponents (§7.1.3), mantissas incl. the grouped 3/5/11-level quantisers (§7.3), coupling with phase flags (§7.4), spectral extension (Annex E §3.6), rematrixing (§7.5), `dynrng` (§7.7.1), AHT (VQ + GAQ, §3.4). |
| `lib.rs` | The crate's API: `Decoder` (bytes in any chunking, resynchronising on 0x0B77), `FrameDecoder` (one whole syncframe, with the statistics the harness reports), `parse_header`, `Options::drc_scale`, the speaker names. rivet's adapter, [`codec/src/audio/decode/ac3.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/ac3.rs), runs its own stream loop over `FrameDecoder`: resynchronises, buffers partial syncframes, derives pts from the sample count, maps errors to `AudioError`, and re-exports `Options` as `Ac3Options`. |

Coverage: **AC-3 (bsid ≤ 8) complete** — block switching, dither, coupling
with phase flags, rematrixing, delta bit allocation, `dynrng` (applied by
default, scalable). **E-AC-3 (bsid 16) independent substream 0 and its
dependent substreams** (their channels put where `chanmap` says,
replacing substream 0's of the same location or added, ETSI TS 102 366
§E.2.8.2, so 7.1 — a 3/2 + LFE 5.1 downmix in substream 0 and a 2/2
dependent substream on Ls, Rs, Lrs/Rrs — decodes as eight channels, FL FR
FC LFE BL BR SL SR; the chanmap names follow Table E.1.4, bit 13 Lts/Rts) — every
`numblkscod`, reduced sample rates, frame exponent strategies, the three
SNR-offset strategies, standard coupling, spectral extension with
attenuation, AHT. Refused by name: enhanced coupling (`ecplinu = 1`), bsid
9/10. Skipped by name (Annex E §3.8.1): independent substreams other than
0; a dependent substream mapped to a location there is no output for
(Lc/Rc, the heights Vhl/Vhr and Vhc, Lts/Rts, the wides, LFE2) is left out. `dialnorm` / `compr`
are parsed, not applied. Output is interleaved f32 in the WAVE order for the
layout (5.1: FL FR FC LFE SL SR), which is what
`channelmap` and the Opus encoder assume for a channel count.

**Licence.** Every table came from the spec on disk; nothing from any other
implementation. The oracles are run only as black boxes.

**Verification** ([`crates/ac3/tests/ac3_decode_vectors.rs`](../crates/ac3/tests/ac3_decode_vectors.rs),
`cargo test -p rivet-ac3`; full figures in the
[crate's README](../crates/ac3/README.md)). A/52 defines the bit allocation in
exact integers but leaves the transform and dequantisation to floating point
and lets dither and the SPX noise be "any reasonably random sequence", so two
conformant decoders agree to float rounding where the stream is
deterministic and differ by their independent noise where it is not. The gate
is therefore relative to a *measured* noise floor (a second decode with the
noise fill off).

- **Against liba52** (an independent AC-3 decoder, through GStreamer's
  `a52dec`), on streams made by aften (an independent AC-3 encoder) from
  known signals — mono to 5.1, 32 / 44.1 / 48 kHz, 64–448 kbit/s, `dynrng`,
  forced block switching — and on Dolby's own AC-3 encode from its Digital
  Plus Online Delivery Kit (`crates/ac3/tools/make_vectors.sh`,
  `fetch_dolby_kit.sh`, `RIVET_AC3_VECTORS=<dir>`): dither-stripped copies
  agree to float rounding (≤ 0.01 LSB16 peak), mixed-transform blocks
  included and nothing masked.
- **E-AC-3** has no decoder but FFmpeg's to compare with, so none is used:
  Dolby's E-AC-3 encode (spectral extension, AHT, GAQ, coupling) is held to
  liba52's decode of Dolby's AC-3 encode of the same programme (SNR, levels
  and bands per channel), and the kit's other E-AC-3 streams must decode
  clean with every CRC good. This catches a wrong channel, level, band or
  transform, not errors below about −20 dB of the signal.
- Until 2026-10-03 the reference was libavcodec, on ffmpeg-made vectors and
  FATE's Dolby streams; that comparison found the cross-channel overlap-add
  libavcodec applies in mixed-transform blocks (`FrameDecoder::mixed_transform_blocks()`
  lists such blocks; `RIVET_AC3_MASK_MIXED` masks them when comparing with a
  decoder that does it). liba52 agrees with this decoder there.
- **Mutation** (run 2026-09-13). `hth[0][47]` 0x0800 → 0x0700 (Table 7.15,
  PDF p.75): `tables::hth_table_7_15` fails (row checksum 50048 ≠ 50304) and
  the fixture cross-check fails in frame 0 with "absolute exponent 25 out of
  0..=24" — the bit allocation hands out different mantissa widths and the
  parse runs into the next channel's exponents.
- **End to end.** `rivet transcode <5.1 AC-3 | E-AC-3 in MP4 / MKV / TS> --audio opus`:
  six-channel, family-1 Opus — and, because a channel count cannot see a
  permutation,
  [`tests/data/opus_channel_identity.py`](../crates/codec/tests/data/opus_channel_identity.py)
  decodes the output with an independent decoder (GStreamer's `opusdec`, a
  black box) and checks every channel carries its source channel's tone (the
  sources carry a distinct tone per channel; rivet's own tests now check the
  same with rivet's decoder). That check is
  what found the Opus encoder of the time feeding its family-1 mapping in the
  native order rather than RFC 7845's ([codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md)):
  every 5.1 source but Vorbis had come out with FC/FR swapped and LFE/SL/SR
  rotated while the stream's header described a perfect 5.1 track. With the
  fix, all seven sources (AC-3 and E-AC-3 in MP4 / MKV / TS, 5.1 Vorbis in
  MKV) pass: every output channel is dominated by its own source channel's
  tone. TS needed the PES
  `private_stream_1` (0xBD) id (ATSC A/53 Part 3 §6.5), which the audio PES
  parser had refused.

Tools, all in the `ac3` crate (`cargo run -p rivet-ac3 --example …`):
[`examples/ac3_decode.rs`](../crates/ac3/examples/ac3_decode.rs) (an AC-3 /
E-AC-3 elementary stream to raw f32 PCM; `RUST_LOG=trace` with
`--features tracing` for the syntax trace, `AC3_DECODE_FRAMES=1` for
per-frame tool usage),
[`examples/ac3_strip_dither.rs`](../crates/ac3/examples/ac3_strip_dither.rs),
[`tests/data/ac3_make_blksw_vector.py`](../crates/ac3/tests/data/ac3_make_blksw_vector.py).

**Why.**
- **Spot tests from the rendered page, not only checksums.** A checksum pins
  a transcription; a spot value re-read from the page pins it to the spec.
  A wrong `hth` entry does not degrade audio, it desynchronises the bit
  allocation and the mantissas parse as garbage from that bin on.
- **A relative gate.** An absolute tolerance either fails conformant
  dithered decodes or lets real bugs through; measuring our own noise
  contribution gives a bound that is tight (float rounding) where the stream
  is deterministic and honest where it is not.
- **The spec wins over the oracle, with the fit as evidence.** Where an
  oracle differs, the disagreement is localised, reproduced from our own
  internals by least squares, and checked for physical sense (continuity at
  the block boundary) before being masked — and the mask is named in every
  report line so it cannot hide.

## AAC decoder

[`AacDecoder`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/aac.rs) adapts the decoder of
the `crates/aac` submodule (the rivet-aac repository; provenance in
[decisions.md §26](decisions.md#26-aac-lc-is-encoded-and-decoded-here-from-the-standards)).
Pure Rust, written from ISO/IEC 13818-7 and 14496-3; no other decoder's
source was consulted.

- **Input.** Raw access units under the AudioSpecificConfig the demuxer keeps
  in `AudioTrack::asc` (MP4 `esds`, Matroska CodecPrivate, or the one the TS
  demuxer synthesises from the first ADTS header), or ADTS bytes when there is
  no configuration.
- **What it decodes.** AAC-LC: channel configurations 1–7 and
  program_config_element layouts, long / start / short / stop windows with
  sine and KBD shapes, M/S, intensity stereo, PNS, TNS and pulse data. Output
  is in the native order for the layout (5.1: FL FR FC LFE BL BR;
  configuration 7: FL FR FC LFE BL BR SL SR), which `layout()` names; a PCE
  whose elements do not fit its own position rules comes out in its element
  order with the layout left to the channel count.
- **HE-AAC.** Spectral band replication and parametric stereo are decoded in
  full (§26): an HE-AAC stream at its SBR rate (twice the core's), an HE-AAC
  v2 stream's mono core to two channels. `AacDecoder::new_core_only` decodes
  the AAC-LC core alone instead (half the rate), which `he-aac=core` asks for.
  `decode::aac::probe` reads the first access unit to say what a stream is
  (explicit signalling in the configuration, or SBR / PS data in the access
  unit) and the rate it decodes to, which the job uses (`he-aac`,
  [output-spec.md](output-spec.md#3-audio--with_audioaudiocodecpolicy)).
- **Refused by name.** AAC Main, SSR, LTP and the other object types, 960-sample
  frames and coupling channel elements: `AudioError::Unsupported`.
- **Verified** against the ISO/IEC 14496-26 conformance streams' reference
  output (AAC-LC and HE-AAC) and against faad2's decoder as a black box, on
  this crate's encoder's streams and on fdk-aac's, to float rounding (figures
  in the submodule's README).

## FLAC and ALAC decoders

**What.** [`audio/decode/flac.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/flac.rs)
and [`audio/decode/alac.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/alac.rs) adapt
the clean-room, pure-Rust lossless decoders of
[`crates/lossless`](../crates/lossless/README.md) (the `lossless` crate, a
git submodule: the
[rivet-lossless](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-lossless)
repository), reached through `audio::create_decoder("flac" | "alac")`. FLAC: every subframe type, wasted
bits, the three stereo modes, 4–32 bits, 1–8 channels, fixed and variable
block sizes, both CRCs, and the STREAMINFO MD5 (a mismatch at the end of the
stream is a warning). ALAC: SCE / CPE / LFE elements, the adaptive predictor
and Rice coder, pair mixing, shifted and escaped elements, 16/20/24/32 bits,
1–8 channels, reordered from ALAC's centre-first layouts to the native order
(four channels reported as 4.0 through `AudioDecoder::layout`). Both have an
exact integer interface (`decode_int`) beside the f32 one. Inputs: MP4
(`fLaC` / `alac`), Matroska (`A_FLAC` / `A_ALAC`) and native `.flac`; ALAC in
CAF is not read. See [lossless-audio.md](lossless-audio.md).

## Other audio decoders

The rest of what `audio::create_decoder` routes to
([`audio/decode/`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/mod.rs)); the Opus, MP3
and Vorbis adapters are described with the encoders in
[codec-encode.md](codec-encode.md#the-audio-pipeline-decode--opus--aac--he-aac--mp3--vorbis--ac-3--e-ac-3--dts--flac--alac).

- **DTS core** ([`audio/decode/dts.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/dts.rs),
  an adapter onto [`crates/dts`](../crates/dts/README.md), the `dts` crate, a
  git submodule: the [rivet-dts](https://github.com/safewords/rivet-dts)
  repository; `"dts" | "dca" | "dtsc"`) — written from ETSI TS 102 114: the core
  substream, up to 5.1 at ≤ 48 kHz. XCh / XXCh / X96 and DTS-HD extension
  substreams are skipped, so a DTS-HD track yields its lossy core. Two
  codebooks ETSI does not print decide the rest: a subband coded with ADPCM
  prediction is refused by name (`AudioError::Unsupported`; most disc-sourced
  DTS predicts somewhere), and high-frequency VQ subbands decode as silence,
  which §5.4.3 allows, with one warning per decoder. Output is in the
  pipeline's native order; the decoder reports its `AMODE` layout. Checked
  by round trips through the crate's own encoder and against libdca's
  decoder, as a black box, on that encoder's streams (levels within 3e-6,
  outputs within 2e-7; [`crates/dts/tests/dcadec.rs`](../crates/dts/tests/dcadec.rs)); the
  tables are generated by
  [`crates/dts/tools/dts_gen_tables.py`](../crates/dts/tools/dts_gen_tables.py)
  from the ETSI PDF.
- **MPEG audio** ([`audio/decode/mp3.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/mp3.rs);
  `"mp3" | "mp2" | "mp1" | …`) — [`crates/mp3`](../crates/mp3/README.md)
  (rivet-mp3, written from ISO/IEC 11172-3 / 13818-3: Layers I, II and III,
  MPEG-1, LSF and 2.5, at ISO's full accuracy on all 64 conformance
  sequences), gapless trimming left to the container's edit.
- **Opus** ([`audio/decode/opus.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/opus.rs))
  — [`crates/opus`](../crates/opus/README.md) (rivet-opus, written from RFC
  6716 / 8251; bit-exact in final range on every packet of the twelve official
  test vectors), multistream for channel-mapping families 0 and 1 (family 255
  is refused by name), always 48 kHz, pre-skip kept for the container's edit
  to remove.
- **Vorbis** ([`audio/decode/vorbis.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/vorbis.rs))
  — [`crates/vorbis`](../crates/vorbis/README.md) (rivet-vorbis, written from
  the Vorbis I specification: floors 0 and 1, residues 0–2, every mapping;
  checked on Xiph's test vectors).
- **Linear PCM** ([`audio/decode/pcm.rs`](../crates/codec/src/audio/decode/pcm.rs);
  `pcm_u8`, `pcm_s16le`, `pcm_s24le`, `pcm_s32le`, `pcm_f32le`, `pcm_f64le`) —
  AVI's WAVE formats converted to f32; a partial sample frame at a packet's
  end waits for the next packet.

Which of these a job may run is the caller's choice: rivet's
`audio-decode-deny` names source codecs that must not be decoded (a denied
track is passed through or the job refused, never silently decoded) — see
[output-spec.md](output-spec.md#restricting-decoders--audio_decode_deny).

## GPU detection

**What.** [`gpu/`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs) enumerates the host's GPUs and
exposes live utilisation. [`detect_gpus()`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L21)
concatenates per-vendor scans (NVIDIA, then AMD, then Intel) into
`Vec<`[`GpuDevice`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/types.rs#L4)`>` (vendor, name,
index, vendor index, generation, PCI id, VRAM, serial, bus address).
[`detect_gpus_cached()`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L87) probes once per
process for callers that would otherwise repeat the NVML / WMI / sysfs walk
per encoder, and [`vendor_index_of(global)`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L101)
translates a global index to the vendor-local one.

**Two indices, because a host can be mixed.** Each per-vendor scan numbers its own
devices from 0, so on an NVIDIA + AMD box both would be index 0. `GpuDevice`
therefore carries **two**: `vendor_index` (the device's position *within its
vendor*, what the per-vendor SDK enumerates — the CUDA ordinal, the QSV/AMF
adapter) and a globally-unique `index` that `detect_gpus` reassigns across the
concatenated list. The global `index` is what the user addresses (`--decode gpu:N`,
the GPU policy) and what `create_decoder_on` matches; it then constructs the
chosen backend with that device's **`vendor_index`** so the hardware selects the
right physical adapter. On a single-vendor host the two coincide.

**Only the AMD / Intel cards this process can open (Linux).** The sysfs walk
sees every card in the machine, but a process reaches a card only through its
DRM render node, and a container is usually handed just some of them (a
Kubernetes device plugin passes through the allocated cards'
`/dev/dri/renderD*`). oneVPL and AMF enumerate only the cards whose render node
they can open, in render-node order. So
[`usable_by_this_process`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L50) keeps an AMD or
Intel card only if its `renderD` node opens read-write, sorts the survivors by
render node and renumbers `vendor_index` to match; a card whose render node
sysfs does not reveal is kept, in its original order. Before this, the extra
cards gave `vendor_index` values naming the wrong adapter and every session on
them failed (`MFXCreateSession -9`). NVIDIA devices are numbered by CUDA and
are not filtered this way; on Windows nothing is filtered.

- **NVIDIA** via [libcuda dlopen](../crates/codec/src/gpu/nvidia.rs#L17) (`cuInit` +
  `cuDeviceGetCount` + `cuDeviceGetName`), enriched by NVML for VRAM/PCI/serial.
  **Why dlopen, not `nvidia-smi`:** minimal container images often lack the
  `nvidia-smi` binary, but the NVIDIA Container Toolkit bind-mounts the driver's
  user-mode libraries — so probing the library directly works where shelling out
  wouldn't. (NVML init even retries the SONAME-versioned `libnvidia-ml.so.1`
  because the toolkit mounts only that, not the unsuffixed alias.)
- **AMD / Intel** via, on **Linux**, a sysfs PCI scan
  ([`amd.rs`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/amd.rs#L5),
  [`intel.rs`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/intel.rs#L5): `/sys/bus/pci/devices`,
  matching vendor `0x1002` / `0x8086` + a display class);
  on **Windows**, a WMI query (`Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController`, cached for
  the process) parsing the `PNPDeviceID` `VEN_`/`DEV_` fields. Both feed the same
  device-id → generation/label tables. This is what makes an AMD GPU visible to
  the AMF decode path on a Windows host (without it the sysfs-only scan returned
  empty there, so only the NVML-detected NVIDIA card showed up). WMI reports
  no usable VRAM (`AdapterRAM` is u32-capped), so `vram_mib` is 0 there.

The generation/label tables ([`nvidia_generation_from_name`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/nvidia.rs#L220),
[`intel_label_from_device_id`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/intel.rs#L163), …) are mostly
cosmetic (the admin inventory page). The Intel labeller was added because,
without it, every Intel device was tagged "Integrated GPU" and the AV1
dispatch's old `contains("arc")` name check missed discrete Arc cards; that
check is gone (see `supports_av1_encode` below).

[`GpuUtilizationReader`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/utilization.rs#L9) holds an NVML handle
across reads and returns a per-device [`GpuUtilization`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/types.rs#L73)
snapshot (compute/encoder/decoder busy %, VRAM, temperature) on each load tick.
NVIDIA reads come from NVML; Intel is a coarse sysfs freq-ratio + DRM-fdinfo VRAM
proxy; AMD is a no-op stand-in (radeontop/amdsmi deferred).

### PCI BAR report

[`bar_report(&GpuDevice)`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/bar.rs#L102) says whether a
discrete card's VRAM window — its largest memory BAR — covers its VRAM, i.e.
whether Resizable BAR is in effect. Linux only, read from sysfs without
privileges: the BAR's current size from `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<bdf>/resource`,
whether the card can resize it and to what from `resourceN_resize` (Linux 6.1+;
`resizable: None` on older kernels), and whether the host is a VM (the CPU's
`hypervisor` flag). It returns `None` on other platforms, for an integrated GPU,
or when sysfs does not say. [`BarReport`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/bar.rs#L22)
carries the fields; `verdict()` gives a
[`BarVerdict`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/bar.rs#L42) (`Full` when the window is at
least half the VRAM, `Small`, or `Unknown` with no VRAM figure); `describe()` is
the one-line text with the cause and the firmware fix (Above 4G Decoding +
Resizable BAR, and passing the full BAR through on a VM); `consequence()` says
what a small window costs on an Intel card.

**Why.** Encode and decode do not care, but Intel's compute runtime (OpenCL,
Level Zero, OpenVINO's GPU plugin) will not expose an Arc card behind a small
BAR on the upstream `i915` driver and says only `WARNING: Small BAR detected`,
while QSV carries on — so the cause is otherwise hard to find. `rivet devices`
prints it as the `PCI BAR` line and `--json` carries it as `pci_bar` (see
[cli.md](cli.md#rivet-devices)).

### `supports_av1_encode` admits everything

[`supports_av1_encode`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L125) returns `true` for every
vendor on purpose. It used to carry a brittle board-name substring list, and a
missed SKU (the RTX 5060, once) would *hard-fail* a job when no software
fallback is built in. The decision was to defer to the **real driver capability query** in the
encoder constructor (`nvEncGetEncodeCaps` / AMF `CreateComponent` / oneVPL
`MFXVideoENCODE_Query`), which authoritatively bails if AV1 silicon is absent — so
detection admits the GPU and lets the real query be the gate.

**Notes / gotchas.** [`manufacturer_label`](../crates/codec/src/gpu/mod.rs#L113)
is the one vendor spelling (`NVIDIA` / `AMD` / `Intel`) that `rivet devices`,
`rivet capabilities` and the GPU policy's messages print; its doc comment
still asks that it stay in lockstep with a `vendor_label` in
`transcoder/src/capabilities.rs`, a file not in this repository. Fields that a platform can't
read (consumer-GeForce serials, older-kernel VRAM) come back empty/`None`/`0`
rather than synthesised, and the literal `"0"` serial is treated as `None` per
NVML's documented sentinel.

---

## The CUDA process-wide lock

**What.** [`cuda_lock.rs`](../crates/codec/src/cuda_lock.rs) is a single
process-wide `Mutex<()>` ([`CUDA_INIT_LOCK`](../crates/codec/src/cuda_lock.rs#L39))
with a poison-tolerant accessor
([`lock_for_cuda_init`](../crates/codec/src/cuda_lock.rs#L43)), compiled only under
the `nvidia` feature.

**Why.** This is a scar from a production segfault. When several NVENC encoder
constructions ran in parallel, the NVIDIA driver segfaulted inside
`NvEncOpenEncodeSessionEx`. Serialising NVENC alone wasn't enough — the *first*
encoder still crashed, because an `NvdecStreamingDecoder` was being constructed on
a sibling thread doing its **own** `cuInit` + `cuCtxCreate` + parser-create at the
same time. The driver's session table can't handle simultaneous CUDA context
creation from different code paths on the same GPU, even when each path is
internally single-threaded. The mutex serialises just the brief
CUDA-init / first-FFI-call window across **both** NVENC and NVDEC; once each
backend has its context + handle it releases the lock and per-frame work runs
concurrently as before. Cost is ~50–200 ms cold-start per run; frame throughput is
unchanged. Poisoning is treated as recoverable because the lock protects no
in-memory invariant — only "no two CUDA inits at once."

---

## Bitstream parsers

**What.** [`pixel_format/`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/mod.rs) — in the
`rivet-frame` crate, re-exported as `codec::pixel_format` — is a set of pure-Rust
bitstream walkers built on a small
[`BitReader`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/bitreader.rs#L5) (Exp-Golomb
`ue`/`se`, AV1 `su`, byte-align; AV1 `uvlc` lives beside the sequence-header
parser). It sits in `rivet-frame` because the demuxers use it and
`rivet-container` does not depend on this crate. Two layers:

1. **Pixel-format detection** — [`detect`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/mod.rs#L35)
   dispatches by codec to `detect_h264` / `detect_hevc` / `detect_vp9` /
   `detect_av1`, which parse the first sequence header for
   `chroma_format_idc` + luma bit depth and map them via
   `PixelFormat::from_chroma_and_depth`. Any parse failure falls back to `Yuv420p`
   (matching the previous hard-coded behaviour — a bad probe degrades payload
   accuracy, it doesn't block the transcode).
2. **Dimension + deep parse** — [`detect_dims`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/mod.rs#L59)
   dispatches to full SPS/sequence-header walkers
   ([`parse_h264_sps`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/h264.rs#L143),
   [`parse_hevc_sps`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/hevc.rs#L273),
   [`parse_mpeg2_sequence_header`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/mpeg2.rs#L29)) that
   go all the way through scaling lists, `pic_order_cnt_type` branches, and frame
   cropping / conformance windows to compute the **displayable** width/height. It
   returns `None` to mean "keep existing dims."

**Why.** Two distinct needs. First, the pipeline wants a fast, codec-agnostic
*format* probe **before** decoder construction — the decoders do not expose a
"just probe the format" API (NVDEC tells us, but only after decode starts), so
this module fills that gap. Second, **MPEG-TS carries no
container-level dimensions** (no sample-entry atom, no track header — the SPS is
the only source), so `container::ts` calls `detect_dims` during demux to populate
`StreamInfo.width`/`.height`, which would otherwise be `0×0`. That's why
`detect_dims` returning `None` is load-bearing for TS but a harmless no-op for
MP4/MKV (which already have dims).

**The deeper parsers** (`H264SpsInfo` / `H264PpsInfo` / `HevcSpsInfo` /
`H265VpsInfo` / `H265PpsInfo` / `H265SliceHeader` /
[`Av1SequenceHeader`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/av1/sequence.rs#L13)
/ [`Av1FrameHeader`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/av1/frame.rs#L15), and
[`parse_h264_pps`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/h264.rs#L487) /
`parse_h264_slice_header` / `parse_h265_*` / [`parse_av1_frame_header`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/av1/frame.rs#L225))
expose far more fields than dimension detection needs — constraint flags, POC
branch predicates, tile info, quantization, loop-filter/CDEF/segmentation. The
struct doc comments say why: these were built to construct the Vulkan Video `Std*`
parameter/picture-info structs for a hand-rolled Vulkan decoder (since removed).
They remain in use: [`Av1SequenceHeader`](../crates/frame/src/pixel_format/av1/sequence.rs#L13)
is the input to the [AV1 codec-string formatter](#hlsdash-codecs-strings),
`H264SpsInfo` / `HevcSpsInfo` feed the H.264 / H.265 ones, and
`parse_h264_sps` / `parse_hevc_sps` give the multi-GPU chunk-stitch its
`H26xInvariant` and the muxer its `avcC` / `hvcC` fields. The module also holds
the VP9 colour reader (`parse_vp9_colour`), the MPEG-2 display-aspect and
colour-description readers, and keyframe / first-slice offset helpers
(`av1_packet_is_keyframe`, `h264_first_slice_nal_offset`, …).

**Notes / gotchas.**
- `detect_av1` walks the full sequence header (through the operating points
  to `color_config`) via `parse_av1_sequence_header`. It used to stop at the
  timing info and answer 8-bit 4:2:0 for every stream, so a 10-bit AV1 source —
  every HDR one — read as 8-bit.
- The AV1 sequence-header parser carries an in-code fix note:
  `initial_display_delay_present_flag` lives **outside** the timing-info branch;
  nesting it (an earlier bug) desynced every following field.
- `remove_h264_rbsp_stuffing` strips emulation-prevention bytes before any SPS
  walk — shared by the H.264 and HEVC paths.

---

## HDR SEI extraction

**What.** [`hdr_sei`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs) (in `rivet-frame`;
[`codec::hevc_sei`](../crates/codec/src/hevc_sei.rs) re-exports it at its old
path) scans an Annex-B buffer for SEI NAL units — HEVC prefix/suffix types 39/40,
H.264 type 6 — and extracts two HDR10 payloads, which have the same syntax in
both codecs: **mastering display colour volume** (payload type 137, H.265
D.2.28 / H.264 D.1.29) and **content light level** (type 144, D.2.35 /
D.1.31). [`parse_annexb`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs#L56) (HEVC),
[`parse_h264_annexb`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs#L61) and
[`parse_annexb_for(codec, …)`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs#L68) return an
[`HdrSei`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs#L27) (`HevcHdrSei` is its old name, kept
as an alias) that callers fold into `ColorMetadata` (it
[`merge`](../crates/frame/src/hdr_sei.rs#L40)s newest-wins since HDR tooling
repeats the SEI on every IRAP). `frame::hdr_sei::parse_av1_obus` reads the same
two from AV1 metadata OBUs; it is not part of the `codec::hevc_sei` re-export.

**Why a hand-rolled parser.** The GPU decoders don't surface SEI messages
through their APIs, and a container may carry no HDR static metadata at all —
no MP4 `mdcv` / `clli`, no Matroska `MasteringMetadata`, and MPEG-TS or AVI
have nowhere to put it — while the stream carries both messages in its first
IRAP access unit (x265 `hdr10=1` does exactly this). The demuxers
(`container::demux::hdr`) read them from there, once, so the values reach the
encoders' SEIs and the output's `mdcv`/`clli` boxes (without which Apple
devices fall back to BT.709 limited even when `colr nclx` signals BT.2020). It
never touches the decode path.

**Notes / gotchas.** The parser strips emulation-prevention bytes per-NAL
before reading fields, decodes the SEI `payload_type`/`payload_size` 0xFF-run
encoding, and **remaps the spec's GBR wire order to the struct's RGB field order**
(`parse_mastering_display`). `probe.rs` re-exports `parse_annexb` as
`parse_hevc_hdr_sei` for callers that want the scan without constructing a
decoder.

---

## Probe

**What.** [`probe.rs`](../crates/codec/src/probe.rs) inspects a media file
**without a full decode**. [`probe_mp4`](../crates/codec/src/probe.rs#L25) reads an
MP4/MOV header via the `mp4` crate into a
[`ProbeResult`](../crates/codec/src/probe.rs#L15) (codec, dims, frame rate from
`sample_count / duration`, bitrate, audio track, file size) and additionally walks
the ISOBMFF box tree by hand
([`probe_mp4_visual_color_metadata`](../crates/codec/src/probe.rs#L108)) to pull
the `mdcv`/`clli` HDR atoms out of the visual sample entry.
[`detect_container`](../crates/codec/src/probe.rs#L234) sniffs MP4/MKV/AVI from
magic bytes.

**Why.** Two reasons it hand-walks boxes instead of trusting the `mp4` crate. The
HDR `mdcv`/`clli` atoms are the canonical container-side HDR10 carriers — without
surfacing them at probe time the muxer can't write them on output. And the helper
deliberately **duplicates** `container::demux::find_box_body` rather than depend on
the `container` crate, to keep `codec` free of a `container` dependency.

**Notes / gotchas.** `probe_mp4` is MP4/MOV-only; non-MP4 inputs are demuxed by the
`container` crate's streaming demuxers (which produce the `StreamInfo` the decoder
consumes — see [pipeline.md §1](pipeline.md#1-demux)). Audio sample-rate/channels
are not yet filled in here (`None`).

---

## HLS/DASH `CODECS=` strings

**What.** [`codec_strings.rs`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs) formats the
exact `CODECS="…"` attribute bytes for an HLS master playlist:
[`av1_codec_string`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs#L60) from a parsed
`Av1SequenceHeader` (`av01.P.LLT.DD.M.CCC.TTT.MMM.F`),
[`avc_codec_string`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs#L92) (`avc1.PPCCLL`
from the SPS's profile, constraint flags and level) and
[`hevc_codec_string`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs#L112), each taking the
sample-entry fourcc (`avc1` / `avc3`, `hvc1` / `hev1`), the constant
[`AAC_LC_CODEC_STRING`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs#L152) (`mp4a.40.2`),
and [`hls_codecs_attribute`](../crates/codec/src/codec_strings.rs#L157) to join
`<video>,<audio>`.

**Why parsed from the bitstream, never composed from config.** These strings are
what hls.js / Safari native HLS / DASH players use to decide playability **before
downloading any media** — a wrong string silently drops the variant. So they must
reflect the actual encoded bitstream. The AV1 formatter encodes a hard-won
playback fix: it emits the **short form** (`av01.0.08M.08`) at SDR BT.709 defaults
and the **long** 9-component form only for HDR/wide-gamut/monochrome/full-range,
because some hls.js/Chrome/Edge versions reject the long form via
`MediaSource.isTypeSupported` even when the underlying `av1C` is byte-identical to
what the same browser plays via direct rendition load. The doc comment on the
function tells that story in full.

---

## The qsv_ffi ABI layer

**What.** [`qsv_ffi.rs`](../crates/codec/src/qsv_ffi.rs) holds the oneVPL `mfx*`
struct mirrors (`MfxFrameInfo`, `MfxInfoMfx`, `MfxVideoParam`, `MfxFrameData`,
`MfxFrameSurface1`, `MfxBitstream`, …) and shared codec/status constants used by
**both** the QSV decoder and the QSV encoder.

**Why it's its own module, and why `offsetof`-verified.** These structs were
previously duplicated in `encode/qsv.rs` and `decode/qsv_dec.rs` — "which is how
the same struct layout bug shipped in two places" (module header). Defining them
once removes that drift. And because we mirror the C ABI by hand, each struct ends
with a [compile-time size assertion](../crates/codec/src/qsv_ffi.rs#L170)
(`MfxFrameInfo == 68`, `MfxInfoMfx == 136`, `MfxVideoParam == 208`,
`MfxFrameSurface1 == 184`, `MfxBitstream == 72`, …). The sizes were verified by
`offsetof` against the installed **oneVPL 2.16** headers on a real Intel Arc box —
explicitly *not* against the dev box's vendored `mfxstructs.h`, which the comment
notes was "a wrong hand-simplified copy." Same rationale as the NVDEC ABI
witnesses: a wrong field offset means the driver reads/writes the wrong bytes
(silent garbage frames or a crash), so the layout is a build-time invariant, not a
runtime hope.

**Notes / gotchas.** The asserts are platform/ABI-sensitive (e.g. `mfxFrameId` is
`[u16; 4]`, 2-aligned, *not* a `u64`; `MfxFrameData` Y/U/V plane pointers land at
offsets 48/56/64). Touching any field without re-checking `offsetof` will trip a
`const` assertion at compile time — which is the point.

---

## Key decisions on the decode side

- **Hand-rolled `dlopen` FFI per vendor, no wrapper crate.** Buys a Windows-MSVC +
  Linux build with just a C toolchain; costs us ownership of the vendor ABI, paid
  back by compile-time size assertions + per-codec shape witnesses (NVDEC) and
  `offsetof`-verified size guards (qsv_ffi).
- **Hardware first; software says so.** No *silent* degradation — every
  software engagement is logged. `create_decoder` dispatches NVDEC → AMF → QSV →
  the native tiers (h26x for H.264/HEVC; av1, prores, vp8, vp9, mpeg2, mpeg4;
  all always present, one per codec) → hard-fail.
- **The workspace owns its software decoders.** `crates/h26x` is written from
  the specs, conformance-tested, threaded and SIMD'd — so the two codecs that
  make up nearly every upload decode on any host without a system library, and
  a licence question does not sit in the software tier. AV1, ProRes, VP8, VP9,
  MPEG-1 / MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2 follow the same rule: each decoder is
  written clean-room from its specification, in a repository of its own,
  carried here as a submodule ([decisions.md §34](decisions.md#34-codecs-we-dont-have-we-write-clean-room-each-in-its-own-repository)).
- **One trait, one normalized output.** Every backend is a `Decoder`
  (`push_sample`/`decode_next`) emitting packed planar YUV — `Yuv420p` /
  `Yuv420p10le` from the GPUs, plus 12-bit and 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 from the software
  tiers, which the colorspace layer narrows — so the decode-once pump and
  everything downstream never branch on which GPU decoded.
- **Streaming over eager.** NVDEC (and QSV/AMF) drain per-sample into bounded
  queues to keep peak RSS flat on long inputs.
- **Typed rejects, not opaque strings.** `NvdecError` distinguishes "format we'll
  never support" from "transient hardware limit" so callers can steer policy.
- **One process-wide CUDA-init lock** across NVENC + NVDEC, because the driver
  segfaults on concurrent context creation from different code paths.
- **Probe + bitstream parsers are pure-Rust and decode-free**, so the pipeline can
  answer "what is this?" (format, dims, HDR metadata, codec strings) before
  constructing a decoder — and recover the data (TS dimensions, H.264 / HEVC
  HDR SEI) that no container layer carries. The parsers and SEI scanner live in
  `rivet-frame` so the demuxers can use them.

> **For maintainers:** `create_decoder` wires no `FallbackDecoder`; the
> fallback that exists is `HardwareThenSoftware`. The dispatch order is stated
> above and in the `decode/mod.rs` module header, which agree.
