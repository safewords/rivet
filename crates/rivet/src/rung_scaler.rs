//! Per-rung scaler task: consume raw normalized source frames from
//! the shared decode pump, scale to rung dims, group K frames into a
//! `SegmentChunk`, push to the rung's `SegmentChunkQueue`.
//!
//! v3 multi-GPU model (2026-05-12): one scaler per rung sits between
//! the shared pump and that rung's encoder workers. The pump fans
//! frames out to every scaler's input channel; each scaler does its
//! own bilinear scale (CPU work) and chunks the result so workers
//! see one chunk per CMAF segment.
//!
//! Scalers exit when their input channel returns `None` (pump closed
//! all senders). On exit, the scaler flushes any in-progress chunk
//! (final partial segment) and closes the queue so encoder workers
//! drain and exit cleanly.
