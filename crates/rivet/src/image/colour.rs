//! Colour: what a source's pixels mean, and turning them into sRGB.
//!
//! A browser shows an untagged picture as sRGB. A source tagged with anything
//! else — an ICC profile (a phone's Display P3, a camera's Adobe RGB) or an
//! H.273 description in a HEIF/AVIF `nclx` — is converted here, with moxcms,
//! before it is scaled and encoded. With `keep_icc` the pixels are left alone
//! and the profile travels into the outputs that can carry one; AVIF output is
//! converted all the same, since its encoder here writes no ICC.
