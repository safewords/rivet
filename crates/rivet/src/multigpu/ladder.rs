//! ```
//!
//! Everything about *how* the ladder is scheduled lives here, once: the
//! range-split decode, the scalers and their continuous segment numbering,
//! the byte-budgeted queues, the workers, the setup guard on the active count
//! and the "finished" rule the finalizers wait on. What differs between the
//! two output paths — what a worker does with a chunk (write a CMAF segment
//! file, or collect its packets) and what a finalizer does with a rung's
//! contributions (merge manifests, or stitch packets) — is passed in.
//!
//! # Two things distinguish this from a worker-per-rung ladder
//!
//! Both are about never letting a card sit idle while work exists.
//!
//! **Workers serve the whole ladder.** Each holds one GPU lease for the life
//! of the job and repeatedly takes the next chunk from whichever rung is
//! furthest behind ([`EncodePolicy::AllGpus`](crate::spec::EncodePolicy::AllGpus)). A per-rung worker idled the
//! moment its rung was blocked even with another rung's chunks sitting ready;
//! it also capped the rungs in flight at the GPU count, so a longer ladder fell
//! back to decoding the source once per rung — and decode is the dominant cost
//! of a transcode. Because no rung can now be left without a consumer, the pump
//! is always shared and the ladder costs exactly one decode however many rungs
//! it has. [`EncodePolicy::PerRung`](crate::spec::EncodePolicy::PerRung) keeps the pinned shape available for
//! comparison and for hosts where placement matters more than throughput.
//!
//! **The decode is split across the cards.** One decoder for the whole ladder
//! is one decoder, and the giveaway that it is the limiter is rungs of very
//! different encode cost advancing in lockstep on the same segment number.
//! [`plan_decode_ranges`](crate::decode_pump::plan_decode_ranges) cuts the
//! source at keyframes that fall on chunk boundaries; one pump per range,
//! pinned to its own card, feeds every rung's scaler, and the numbering stays
//! continuous across the join ([`DecodePolicy`](crate::spec::DecodePolicy)). A source that cannot be split
//! safely is decoded whole, which is exactly the behaviour before ranges
//! existed.
//!
//! One encoder per GPU is still exactly true: `capacity` workers, each holding
//! its lease for its lifetime, each running one encode at a time. That
//! invariant is load-bearing — concurrent sessions on one device deadlocked at
//! init — and nothing here widens it.
