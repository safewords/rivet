//! GPU-pool construction helpers derived from [`crate::spec::EncodePolicy`].
//!
//! The one decision here that is not a filter: what the ladder gets when the
//! policy selects **no card that can encode the job's codec** in this build.
//! If the build carries a software encoder for the codec, that is a pool of
//! software slots ([`GpuPool::software`]) sized by [`software_pool_plan`];
//! otherwise there is nothing to encode on and [`gpu_pool_for_policy`]
//! **refuses**, by name, before a frame is decoded. A policy that *pins* a
//! card or a vendor never falls to software — it asked for that silicon by
//! name, and quietly encoding on the CPU instead is exactly the silent
//! narrowing the software tiers are gated against.
//!
//! An empty pool is never handed to a caller. It used to be — the ladder's
//! first lease claim was meant to catch it — but by then the decode pumps and
//! scalers were already running in blocking threads, the error path did not
//! stop them, and a run with more chunks than the queues hold sat at `0/N
//! frames` forever: the scaler blocked on a full queue nobody would drain,
//! the pump behind it, and the runtime could not shut down. The refusal now
//! lives where the emptiness is decided.
