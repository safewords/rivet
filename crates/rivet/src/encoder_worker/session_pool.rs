//! One worker's encoder session, kept between chunks.
//!
//! The chunked single-file path used to build a fresh encoder for every
//! chunk. That was the simplest way to make each chunk an independently
//! decodable IDR-led GOP — which the stitcher depends on, because chunks are
//! encoded out of order across cards and concatenated — and it cost a
//! session construction per chunk: on NVENC a CUDA context, a driver session,
//! a capability query, a preset query and two sixteen-slot buffer rings;
//! about 1300 times on a feature-length file.
//!
//! [`Encoder::reset`] is the same guarantee without the construction: the
//! backend restarts its stream in place, so the next frame is an IDR that
//! opens a closed GOP and nothing of the previous chunk — references,
//! rate-control history, queued packets — survives. This pool is the small
//! amount of bookkeeping that lets a worker use it.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One slot per pool, one pool per worker. A ladder worker holds one GPU
//! lease and serves every rung, so it hops between encoder configurations
//! (one per rung); the slot holds the session of whichever rung it served
//! last. A matching configuration is reused after a reset; a different one
//! evicts. Holding a session per rung instead would multiply live driver
//! sessions per card by the ladder depth — consumer NVIDIA drivers cap
//! those, and every one owns two rings of surfaces — for a saving that is
//! only a rung hop, which the scheduler makes rarer than a chunk.
//!
//! # When the backend cannot reset
//!
//! [`ResetUnsupported`] is a type, not a message, and the pool matches on it:
//! that backend is rebuilt for every chunk, silently, exactly as before. A
//! reset that *fails* is also a rebuild, but at `warn`, because it means a
//! backend that claims the capability could not deliver it on this stream.
//!
//! # Counters
//!
//! [`PoolStats`] is the evidence that the pool did what it says: `built`
//! counts constructions, `reused` counts resets that succeeded. On a run
//! that used to construct N encoders, `built + reused == N` and the saving
//! is `reused`. Workers log the stats when they exit.
//!
//! # The control
//!
//! `RIVET_ENCODER_POOL=off` makes every pool drop its session on release, so
//! every chunk builds — the behaviour before this module existed, in the same
//! binary. That is what a before/after measurement compares against; a
//! separate build is a separate set of variables.
