//! Per-title quality: ask the content how many bits it needs, instead of
//! telling it.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Every rung in a ladder is encoded at a quality derived from two enums and
//! a per-rung offset, and none of that has ever looked at the video. Easy
//! content — flat animation, a screen recording, a locked-off shot — gets the
//! same quantizer as a handheld night scene, so one of them is always wrong:
//! either the easy clip is spending bits nobody can see, or the hard one is
//! being starved.
//!
//! The fix is the oldest idea in per-title encoding: encode a sample of *this*
//! clip at several settings, measure, and keep the cheapest that still looks
//! acceptable. [`codec::bench`] does the encoding and scoring; this module
//! decides **what to sample** ([`sample_frames`]), runs the candidates
//! **across the GPU pool** ([`sweep_on_pool`]), and turns the answer into a
//! ladder-wide [`EncodeOverrides`] ([`select_shift`]). A caller composes the
//! three — with its own reporting between them — or calls
//! [`choose_quality_shift`] for the whole thing.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do: vary the ladder's *shape* — the rungs,
//! their resolutions, or the per-rung steps between them. Those are decisions
//! about what devices and networks exist, not about this clip. It shifts the
//! whole ladder up or down by one number, which is the part the content has
//! an opinion about. Netflix-style per-title builds a convex hull over
//! (resolution, rate, quality); this is a deliberate subset of that.
//!
//! # Which seconds get sampled
//!
//! One contiguous run the length of a segment, from the middle, checked
//! against the pixels rather than trusted. A clip that fades in from black
//! opens on frames that cost nothing at every candidate and score
//! near-perfectly against themselves; a sweep taken there concludes the
//! content is free and shifts the whole ladder cheaper on the strength of a
//! fade. Windows that read as blank are skipped — see [`sample_frames`].
//!
//! # Why SSIM and not VMAF
//!
//! VMAF is a trained model and its coefficient file; putting it in a worker
//! means vendoring libvmaf. For *ranking candidates on one clip* — which is
//! the only thing this does — SSIM orders them the same way, and the absolute
//! number never leaves this module.
