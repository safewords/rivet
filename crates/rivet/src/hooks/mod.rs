//! Hooks: caller-supplied code run at specific points of every job.
//!
//! Each kind of hook has its own trait, written for one place in the pipeline
//! and handed exactly what exists there:
//!
//! | Kind | Trait | Register with | Where it hooks in | Handed |
//! |------|-------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
//! | source | [`SourceHook`] | [`Hooks::source`] | the source bytes, before anything parses them; once per input (each clip of a splice) | [`SourceEvent`] |
//! | probe | [`ProbeHook`] | [`Hooks::probe`] | the source once demuxed (an image once its header is read), before anything is decoded | [`ProbeEvent`] |
//! | decoded frame | [`DecodedFrameHook`] | [`Hooks::decoded_frames`] | video frames as the decoder produced them, turned upright — before tonemapping, chroma or bit-depth conversion, the spec's filters or any scaling | [`FrameEvent`] |
//! | encoder frame | [`EncoderFrameHook`] | [`Hooks::encoder_frames`] | video frames exactly as the encoders receive them — after the colour pipeline and the filters, before per-rung scaling | [`FrameEvent`] |
//! | still | [`StillHook`] | [`Hooks::stills`] | still pictures in an image job: the decoded image, or each still taken from a video | [`StillEvent`] |
//! | artifact | [`ArtifactHook`] | [`Hooks::artifacts`] | each output of the [`ArtifactKind`]s it accepts, before the job returns it | [`ArtifactEvent`] |
//! | completed | [`CompletedHook`] | [`Hooks::completed`] | the job made everything it was asked for (its last gate: it can still reject) | [`CompletedEvent`] |
//! | failed | [`FailedHook`] | [`Hooks::failed`] | the job failed, a rejection by a hook included | [`FailedEvent`] |
//!
//! Each answers with a [`HookOutcome`]: a [`Verdict`] (carry on, or reject the
//! job) and any [`Annotation`]s it wants recorded. Everything a job's hooks
//! said is collected into a [`HookReport`], returned with the output
//! ([`JobOutput::hooks`](crate::job::JobOutput)) and, for a job that was
//! stopped, readable from the session the caller started.
//!
//! The frame hooks choose which frames they are handed ([`FrameSampling`]): a
//! decode produces every frame, and a hook rarely needs them all.
//!
//! The general [`Hook`] trait — any set of [`Stage`]s, one `call` for all of
//! them — is what the kinds adapt to, and is there for the rare hook that
//! genuinely spans a job ([`Hooks::with`]).
//!
//! The engine has no opinion on what a hook is for. The built-in ones compute
//! and record: [`SourceDigest`] (content digests of the source bytes),
//! [`PerceptualFingerprint`] (perceptual hashes of decoded frames, encoder
//! frames or stills) and [`ArtifactDigest`] (digests of outputs). What is done
//! with a digest or a hash is the integration's: the building blocks are
//! public ([`phash`], [`DigestAlgorithm`], [`frame`]), so a custom hook
//! computes exactly what a built-in one does and takes it from there.
//!
//! ## Blocking, background, and failure
//!
//! Each registered hook carries a [`HookPolicy`]. A **blocking** hook runs on
//! the thread that reached its stage and its verdict takes effect at once — a
//! rejected source never reaches the demuxer, a rejected frame stops every
//! decode pump. A **background** hook runs on the session's worker thread so a
//! slow one does not hold up the pipeline; a rejection from it stops the job
//! at the next stage it reaches, and at the latest before the job returns its
//! output, because the job waits for its background hooks before it finishes.
//!
//! A hook that errors is recorded, and then either ignored
//! ([`OnError::Continue`], the default) or treated as a rejection
//! ([`OnError::Reject`]) — fail open or fail closed, as the deployment needs.
//!
//! ## Sessions
//!
//! A [`Hooks`] value is the set of hooks; a *session* is one job's run of
//! them: its id, its records, its rejection. The engine starts one for every
//! job that has hooks, unless the caller started one already
//! ([`Hooks::session`]) — which is how a caller gets at the report of a job
//! that failed or was rejected: keep a clone of the sessioned `Hooks` and call
//! [`Hooks::report`] whatever the job returned.
//!
//! ```
