//! Fitting a source into a rung's box — how an explicit `WxH` rung is sized.
//!
//! A rung's width and height are a **bounding box**, not the output size. The
//! output keeps the source's display shape (non-square samples included) and,
//! unless asked, is never larger than the source. How the picture meets the
//! box is the [`Fit`]:
//!
//! | fit | output | picture |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `contain` (default) | inside the box, the source's shape | whole |
//! | `cover` | the box's shape | centre-cropped to fill it |
//! | `pad` | exactly the box | whole, letterboxed or pillarboxed in black |
//! | `stretch` | exactly the box | whole, distorted to fill it |
//!
//! `stretch` is what every explicit rung did before fitting existed: a 640x480
//! source through a 1280x720 rung came out 1280x720, stretched sideways and
//! upscaled. It is kept for a caller who asks for it by name.
//!
//! The box turns with the source ([`Orientation::Auto`]): a 1920x1080 rung on
//! a portrait source is read as 1080x1920, so a phone video keeps its shape
//! through a landscape ladder. A rung that wants its box as written — a 9:16
//! social rung that crops a landscape source to vertical — is
//! [`Orientation::Fixed`].
//!
//! Without `upscale`, a source smaller than the box comes out at its own size
//! (even-aligned). Rungs that collapse onto the same output that way are
//! merged by [`fit_rungs`], which reports the ones it dropped.
//!
//! # Odd sizes
//!
//! 4:2:0 video is laid out in 2x2 blocks, so an output is even-sized unless
//! its codec carries odd sizes ([`codec::encode::codes_odd_sizes`]: AV1, VP8,
//! VP9, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2 and ProRes from rivet's own encoders), whose
//! rungs are planned on a one-sample grid ([`fit_rungs_aligned`]): a 351x241
//! source comes out 351x241. H.264 and H.265 cannot code an odd 4:2:0 size
//! (their cropping counts in chroma samples), and neither can a hardware
//! encoder's surfaces. For those, a picture whose fitted size is its own
//! evened down (one column or row short, no more) is **cropped** to it:
//! the last column and row are dropped and every other sample is kept as it
//! was, rather than the whole picture being resampled 0.3 % smaller (which
//! blurs every sample a little and shifts the picture by up to half a
//! sample). The crop takes the right and bottom edges, as the codecs' own
//! cropping does.
//!
//! The output always has square samples: an anamorphic 720x576 at 64:45 is
//! resized as the 1024x576 picture it is shown as.
