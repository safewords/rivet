//! ProRes through `decode::create_decoder`.
//!
//! ProRes is decoded by this workspace's own decoder (`crates/prores`, the
//! rivet-prores repository, written clean-room from SMPTE RDD 36), always
//! compiled. Before it, libavcodec was the only backend that took the label,
//! and it was removed on 2026-10-02 (no FFmpeg; see `crates/codec/Cargo.toml`).
//! NVDEC, AMF, QSV and h26x all decline it. What this pins is that the report
//! and the dispatch agree, and that the ProRes tier is there.
//!
//! The fourcc-to-label mapping for the six Apple ProRes fourccs is covered
//! by the container demuxer's unit tests; this is the layer after it.
