//! Native H.264 / H.265 encode in software — rivet's own encoders.
//!
//! The `h26x` crate is this workspace's pure-Rust H.264 and H.265 codec pair.
//! Its decoders are bit-exact against the JVT and JCT-VC conformance suites;
//! its encoders are the mirror of them, built on the same reconstruction
//! kernels, and held to a four-property gate (`h26x/tools/verify_encode.sh`):
//! our decoder reproduces the encoder's own reconstruction byte for byte
//! (**SELF**), the ITU-T reference decoders (JM, HM) agree with ours
//! (**CROSS**), PSNR is reported,
//! and a rate objective, where one is set, is hit. No C, no system library,
//! nothing to install on a build host — so, like the decoders, this module is
//! always compiled.
//!
//! # Where it sits
//!
//! Below every hardware tier: a fixed-function block is faster and costs no
//! CPU. It is the last tier for the two codecs it serves, the way
//! [`av1_sw`](super::av1_sw) is for AV1, and it exists for the same
//! hosts — a laptop, a CI runner, a container with no GPU attached — where a
//! slow file beats a diagnostic.
//!
//! # Always built; the feature decides whether it is *reached*
//!
//! `h26x-fallback` gates whether [`select_encoder`](super::select_encoder)
//! **falls back** here on its own when every hardware backend has declined.
//! Off by default, for the reason `av1-sw-fallback` is: a throughput fleet
//! quietly degrading into a CPU encoder reads as a capacity problem rather
//! than the missing driver it is. A caller that wants software encoding can
//! always ask for it by name, feature or no feature.
//!
//! # What it takes
//!
//! 4:2:0 at 8 or 10 bits for both codecs — at 10, little-endian `u16`
//! planes, the pipeline's `yuv420p10le`. H.265 is written as Main / Main 10,
//! H.264 as High / High 10 (`profile_idc` 110, the depth in the SPS's
//! `bit_depth_luma_minus8`). This is the only tier here with 10-bit H.264:
//! no hardware backend has a High 10 encoder (NVENC has no High 10 profile
//! GUID, oneVPL no `AVC High 10`, AMF no 10-bit `Profile`), which is why
//! [`backend_output_caps_for`](super::backend_output_caps_for) reports H.264
//! at 10 bits for this backend alone. Any other format is refused by name
//! rather than narrowed; the pipeline converts its other chroma layouts
//! before the encoder anyway.
//!
//! # Colour
//!
//! The stream says what colour it is: `config.color_metadata` becomes the
//! SPS VUI's colour description (`video_signal_type_present_flag` — the
//! H.273 primaries / transfer / matrix codes and the range flag), the same
//! signalling the hardware backends write, so a BT.2020 PQ or HLG picture
//! is shown as HDR by players that read the bitstream before the
//! container's `colr` box (and by the ones that never read the box).
//! Written for every stream, SDR included — rivet always knows its output
//! colour, and a stream that says BT.709 is better than one that leaves
//! the player to assume it. `backend_output_caps` therefore reports this
//! tier as 10-bit **with** HDR, and an `Hdr10` / `Hlg` policy validates on
//! a build with no GPU. The HDR10 static metadata, when the source had it
//! (`mastering_display`, `content_light_level`), goes into the bitstream
//! too — the mastering display colour volume and content light level SEIs
//! (137 / 144) in every IDR access unit, for both codecs — beside the
//! container's `mdcv` / `clli`. The chroma siting (`chroma_sample_loc_type`,
//! which the encoders can also write) is not signalled: the pipeline does
//! not carry one, and a wrong siting costs more than none.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! Each encoder runs its own worker pool sized to `threads`, or to the
//! machine when that is zero (`H26X_THREADS` overrides). The pipeline runs a
//! ladder's rungs as separate encoders, so a caller running several at once
//! should hand each a share.
//!
//! # Rate
//!
//! Constant QP — the tuning table's quantiser for the rung's target, or its
//! CRF — unless the rung names a bitrate (`EncodeOverrides::bitrate`). Then
//! the encoder's own rate controller picks a quantiser per picture to spend
//! it (`RateControl::Bitrate`), with the rung's coded picture buffer
//! (`buffer_ms`, which writes the HRD and holds every picture inside it)
//! and, for H.265, its lookahead. Every encoder is a stream of its own and
//! its controller starts from nothing: the whole file on the serial path, a
//! chunk after its lead-in on the chunked one, and one segment on the HLS
//! ladder. A request this tier cannot code — a rate beside a CRF or under
//! `constant_qp`, a buffer without a rate — is refused by name
//! ([`rate_refusal`], which also judges an AV1 rung for the software AV1
//! encoder: an average rate without a buffer); the hardware backends refuse
//! an average rate. A
//! constant-rate rung (`RateMode::Constant`) is a bitrate rung with the
//! encoders' `cbr` set: `cbr_flag` in the HRD and filler data holding the
//! rate — see [`CODES_CONSTANT_RATE`].
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! B pictures are enabled from `overrides.bframes` (non-pyramid: a fixed run
//! of B pictures between anchors, matching the NVENC/QSV plumbing). With
//! them coding order is not display order, so a coded picture's timestamp is
//! not the one that just arrived — it is the timestamp of the picture at the
//! access unit's stream-wide *display* index. The encoder reports that index
//! (`Access::display`); the muxer carries the composition offsets it implies.
//! Left at zero the tier is byte-identical to the no-B one it replaced.
