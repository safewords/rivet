//! Backend-agnostic encode overrides, and the policy that resolves them.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Everything in `adapters.rs` derives its numbers from two enums — a
//! [`QualityTarget`] and a [`SpeedTier`] — and nothing else. That is a fine
//! default and a poor ceiling: it produced one quality value for every rung of
//! an ABR ladder, which is how a 240p rung ended up spending four times the
//! bits per pixel of its 1080p sibling. The lower rungs of a ladder exist to be
//! cheap, and a constant quantizer makes them expensive.
//!
//! The fix is not a special case for "ICQ +2 per rung". It is that the caller —
//! the service that knows what a rung is *for* — gets to say so, and this
//! module is the vocabulary it says it in. Every knob a backend understands is
//! expressed here once, backend-agnostically, and each adapter applies whatever
//! it can honour.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! [`EncodeOverrides`] is the knob set. Every field is optional and `None`
//! means "leave whatever the target and tier already chose" — so an empty
//! override is exactly today's behaviour, and a caller only names what it wants
//! to change.
//!
//! [`RungPolicy`] resolves overrides for one rung: a global set, then any
//! number of [`RungRule`]s whose [`RungSelector`] matches, applied in order.
//! Later rules win. That is enough to express "every rung two steps softer than
//! the one above it", "nothing above 1080p", "the top rung gets a little back",
//! and things nobody has thought of yet, without this module knowing what any
//! of them mean.
//!
//! # What it deliberately is not
//!
//! It is not a per-encoder settings blob. A caller that wants to set
//! `NV_ENC_CONFIG_AV1::numFwdRefs` directly should not be able to, because that
//! request cannot be honoured by QSV or a software encoder and a ladder that silently
//! behaves differently per GPU vendor is worse than one that is merely
//! suboptimal. Knobs live here only once they mean something everywhere — or
//! once the adapters that cannot honour them say so.
