/// queue and for as long as the frame is a prediction reference — and signals
/// that by keeping `mfxFrameData.Locked` above zero. A pool sized to the async
/// depth alone leaves no surface free to write the next frame into.
///
/// This used to be a 4-slot ring indexed round-robin, which meant frame N and
/// frame N+4 shared a surface. On a fresh encoder, `EncodeFrameAsync` answers
/// `MFX_ERR_MORE_DATA` for the first few frames: the runtime has taken the
/// surface but produced no sync point. The reuse guard only waited on slots
/// that had a sync point, so those slots looked free — and frame 4 overwrote
/// frame 0's surface while the runtime was still holding it. The picture the
/// encoder eventually emitted for frame 0 carried frame 4's pixels.
///
/// Because a fresh encoder is built per CMAF segment, that happened at every
/// segment: the first frame of each showed the frame four later, then snapped
/// back. Slots are now chosen by looking for one the runtime has released, so
/// the size is headroom rather than a correctness argument.
