//! Pull-based streaming demuxer (Squad streaming-migration-55 P1).
//!
//! Replaces the materialize-everything-upfront `demux()` shape with a
//! `next_video_sample()` iterator. Each per-format implementation
//! holds only the reader state it needs to produce ONE sample at a
//! time; nothing accumulates across samples. The legacy `demux()` is
//! preserved as a thin adapter that drains the iterator into a `Vec`
//! so existing callers keep working unchanged.
//!
//! Memory characteristic: peak heap from any one `next_video_sample()`
//! call is bounded by the sample size + the reader's internal cursor
//! state (mp4 0.14 keeps stbl indexes in the `Mp4Reader`; matroska-
//! demuxer keeps its own cluster cursor; the TS / AVI walks track
//! only an offset). Audio passthrough remains buffered per the
//! pinned contract — Squad-18's pattern is unchanged.
