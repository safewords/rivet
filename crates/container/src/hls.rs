//! HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) playlist generation for CMAF VOD output.
//!
//! Produces:
//!   - `master.m3u8` — the top-level multivariant playlist with one
//!     `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` per video rendition and one
//!     `#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO` rendition group entry pointing at the
//!     shared audio playlist.
//!   - `<rendition>/playlist.m3u8` per video rendition — VOD media
//!     playlist with `#EXT-X-MAP` referring to the rendition's
//!     `init.mp4` and `#EXTINF` lines pointing at the
//!     `seg-NNNNN.m4s` files (relative URIs).
//!   - `<audio_dir>/audio.m3u8` — the shared audio media playlist.
//!   - `<subs_dir>/subtitles.m3u8` per subtitle rendition — a media playlist
//!     of segmented WebVTT (`seg-NNNNN.vtt`, no `EXT-X-MAP`), one rendition
//!     per language in the `SUBTITLES` group (RFC 8216 §3.5, §4.3.4.1).
//!
//! Spec: RFC 8216 (HLS) + Apple's HLS Authoring Spec for VOD content,
//! plus AV1-CMAF-HLS interoperability notes from hls.js's test suite.
//! We target HLS protocol version 7 — the minimum that supports
//! `EXT-X-MAP` (fMP4 init segment) and `EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS`.
//!
//! Codec strings (the load-bearing `CODECS` attribute) are passed in
//! by the caller — they MUST be parsed from the actual encoded
//! bitstream by `codec::codec_strings::av1_codec_string` (rivet-codec), not
//! composed from a config file. A wrong string causes hls.js / Safari
//! to silently skip the variant.
